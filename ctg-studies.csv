NCT06964672,Photon Counting Computed Tomography in Heart Failure Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06964672,PCCT-HF,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Patients with severe acute or chronic heart failure are increasing worldwide. Heart failure clinicians are faced daily with the need to set up short- and long- term therapeutic strategies in line with heart failure etiology and myocardial recovery chances of each patient. Current treatment strategies for severe heart failure also include mechanical circulatory support with artificial devices (such as intraaortic balloon pump, Impella, ECMO, durable left ventricular assist device), which poses specific challenges for cardiac imaging. Through its ability to directly visualize scar and evaluate its transmural extent, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) offers a unique advantage over other currently available imaging techniques as a central player in viability assessment in patients with coronary disease, and represents the first line technique to investigate the chances of myocardial function recovery. CMR is also an important tool to provide diagnostic data in patients with non-ischemic heart failure. Unfortunately, CMR is not feasible in many heart failure patients (for example those on MCS therapy) due to the metallic components of the mechanical devices. In these patients, the computed tomography (CT) is the alternative imaging technique to visualize cardiac structures, diagnose complications, and assess possible indications for surgical interventions. However, CT has poorer resolution and do not offer the possibility to evaluate myocardial viability in patients with contraindication to CMR. Therefore, this issue currently represents one of the major unmet needs in the clinical management of severe heart failure patients.

Recent technological advances in the field of CT imaging have nevertheless paved the way to explore new pathways of myocardial viability assessment even in patients traditionally deemed unsuitable for CMR. The introduction of photon-counting detectors, in particular, is expected to be the next major breakthrough in clinical x-ray computed tomography (CT). Photon-counting detector (PCD)-CT will overcome several shortcomings and limitations of current CT systems: it might substantially improve and expand the applicability of CT imaging by offering intrinsic spectral capabilities, increased spatial resolution, reduced electronic noise and improved image contrast. On the basis of this physical principle PCCT has the promise to improve the actual not fully satisfactory quality of scar visualization in CT images. In particular, conventional scanners are affected by a limited contrast resolution which lead to a variable and relevant rate of false negative myocardial scar-free images depending on the assessor expertise. The constant improving of CT diagnostic field have been revolutionizing the diagnostic workflow in several cardiac disease. Late contrast enhancement CT demonstrated an adequate accuracy to detect and discriminate the etiology of both ischemic and non-ischemic causes of myocardial injury compared to actual gold standard exams in patients with a troponin-positive acute chest pain syndrome. The same technique showed good sensitivity, specificity and a high negative predictive value (95%) for the identification of myocardial scars imputed to be an anatomical substrate of ventricular tachycardia with a proper concordance with electro-anatomic mapping findings (k=0.536). Finally, this enormous potential of CT implementation with the novel PCCT will provide not only the possibility to further study myocardial viability, but also is expected to be superior to standard CT exams in details definition, reduction of electronic noise and increase of spatial resolution, with consequent specific advantages in patients with heart failure, especially those with artificial devices with metallic components, in which adverse event identification and definition (such as inflow or outflow thrombosis) is complex. Thanks to these multiple diagnostic and therapeutic advantages, in combination with the availability of the PCCT device, the use of such technique is now the preferred cardiac imaging examination for the study of cardiac anatomy and function in patients with severe heart failure and a contraindication to perform the gold standard CMR.

NCT06964516,A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study on Minimally Invasive Breast Effects Between the Modified Local Compression Bandaging Method and the Traditional Whole Breast Compression Bandaging Method,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06964516,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"I. Research Background Due to the relatively large trauma to the breast caused by traditional general anesthesia surgery, long recovery time, high incidence of postoperative complications, and patients' fear of general anesthesia surgery, the Mammotome minimally invasive rotary excision surgery has emerged. This minimally invasive breast surgery has very prominent advantages, mainly manifested as visualization, small incisions, and safety and reliability.

Currently, the commonly used bandaging method after minimally invasive breast surgery in clinical practice is the whole-breast compression bandaging method. One or two sterile loose gauze pieces are kneaded into a gauze ball and pressed on the residual cavity. Then, 5 to 8 loose gauze pieces are continuously stacked with the gauze ball within a 5 cm diameter around the wound for bandaging. Finally, an elastic bra is used for another day of compression bandaging. The elastic bra is a special compression elastic bandage for postoperative breast use to achieve auxiliary therapeutic effects such as clearing the cavity and protecting the surgical incision.

However, in the process of clinical practice, it has been found that this bandaging method brings great discomfort to patients. It is not only reflected in varying degrees of skin itching on the covered skin, and there are many cases of local red rashes. Moreover, it affects the patients' breathing. The vast majority of patients complain of pain and discomfort caused by the tight binding on the chest and back, feeling restless when sitting or lying down. At night, they can only sleep in a semi-sitting position and are largely unable to enter a deep sleep, seriously affecting the patients' daily activities and sleep conditions.

In order to improve the patients' experience and reduce their discomfort as much as possible, the medical and nursing joint team explored and improved the compression bandaging method after minimally invasive surgery and found that the local compression bandaging method is more comfortable. That is, one or two loose gauze pieces are kneaded into a gauze ball to replace multiple gauze balls and placed at the residual cavity. Then, elastic medical adhesive tape is used for local compression and sticking. Finally, a pure cotton clean towel is placed inside the elastic bra, and the elastic bra is worn for one day.

According to the results of a pre-experiment involving 50 cases, among the patients using the local compression bandaging method, there was no occurrence of wound hematoma, and their skin itching, chest and back pain, comfort level, and sleep conditions were all improved. In order to further compare the application effects of the whole-breast compression bandaging method and the local compression bandaging method, the research team of this study intends to conduct a comparative study of the two methods.

II. Research Objectives Research Objectives: Through a randomized controlled study, compare and study the curative effects of two different bandaging methods, namely the whole-breast bandaging method and the local bandaging method, during the perioperative period of minimally invasive breast surgery.

NCT06964490,Effect of Different Apex Locators on Postoperative Pain in Endodontic Retreatment of Single-Rooted Teeth: Prospective Randomized Clinical Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06964490,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Nonsurgical endodontic retreatment is a vital procedure that promotes periapical healing by eliminating previous root canal fillings, necrotic tissue, and residual microorganisms, thanks to the comprehensive cleaning of the root canal system \[1\]. The successful disinfection of intricate anatomical structures, such as dentinal tubules, lateral canals, and isthmuses, largely depends on the effective removal of obturation materials \[2\]. Even in the absence of coronal leakage or recurrent caries, persistent clinical symptoms or radiographic evidence of periapical pathology may indicate treatment failure, warranting retreatment \[3\]. Residual bacteria and remnants of root filling materials are known contributors to posttreatment disease \[4\].

A key factor in the success of both primary endodontic treatment and retreatment is the accurate determination of working length (WL), which dictates the apical extent of canal instrumentation and obturation \[5\]. Inadequate WL may result in over-instrumentation, leading to periapical irritation and postoperative pain \[6\]. WL is generally defined as the distance from a coronal reference point to the location where canal cleaning, shaping, and filling should ideally terminate, often coinciding with the apical constriction, and occasionally with the cementodentinal junction, where pulpal and periodontal tissues transition \[5\].

Although periapical radiographs are still commonly used for WL determination, they do not always provide definitive results due to certain limitations. Factors such as improper film placement, angular distortion, image magnification and distortion, patient exposure to ionizing radiation, and the superimposition of anatomical structures can compromise the accuracy of measurements \[7\]. As a result, electronic apex locators (EALs) have gained prominence as a dependable and objective tool for determining WL, offering real-time measurements less influenced by operator variability or anatomical distortions \[6\].

The initial generations of electronic apex locators (EALs) exhibited inconsistent readings and limited accuracy, particularly in the presence of irrigation solutions or tissue fluids. However, recent advancements have significantly enhanced the reliability and clinical performance of EALs. Modern EALs, such as the ProPex Pixi (Dentsply, Switzerland) and Root ZX (J. Morita, Japan) apex locators, utilize multiple-frequency impedance measurements to detect changes as the file approaches the minor apical foramen \[8\]. These devices are equipped with microprocessors that analyze real-time impedance variations, allowing for dynamic and accurate assessment of canal length during instrumentation. Thanks to these technological enhancements, contemporary EALs can precisely identify the apical constriction, even under challenging clinical conditions \[9\]. Recent studies have demonstrated that modern devices can achieve up to 90% accuracy in WL determination, making them indispensable tools in both primary and secondary endodontic procedures \[9, 10\]. Raypex (Raypex 6, VDW GmbH, Munich, Germany) is another widely used electronic apex locator (EAL). Aydın et al. \[11\] demonstrated that Raypex 6 showed success rates of 85% and 95% within ±0.5 mm and ±1 mm, respectively, in teeth with mature apices. Although apex locators function with the same principle, the areas detected by different devices may differ. These variations in apical measurements among different EALs may not only affect treatment accuracy but could also influence the extent of postoperative pain experienced by the patient.

Postoperative pain is a significant concern in endodontics, with its incidence ranging from 3% to 58% \[12\]. Irritation of periradicular tissues during root canal treatment induces an acute inflammatory response, leading to the release of chemical mediators and changes in local pressure and tissue adaptation \[13\]. Accurate WL determination plays a critical role in minimizing postoperative pain \[14\]. Although the use of electronic EALs in WL determination during root canal treatment has been widely accepted, there are only a limited number of clinical studies investigating their effect on postoperative pain. Recent studies have explored the clinical performance and accuracy of different EALs; however, their focus was primarily on measurement precision rather than postoperative outcomes like pain or patient comfort \[7, 15\].

Despite the increasing use of EALs in endodontic procedures, there is currently no clinical study that examines the impact of using different apex locator devices on postoperative pain in the nonsurgical endodontic retreatment. Given the added complexity of retreatment cases, such as the need to remove previous obturation materials and the potential for greater periapical irritation, this represents a significant gap in the literature. The primary aim of this randomized clinical study is to evaluate and compare the effect of WL determination using different apex locator",NO,Retreatment,DEVICE: determination of working length,"Postoperative Pain Intensity Assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Postoperative pain intensity will be evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), a 100-mm line where patients mark their pain level.

Losing muscle can lead to a reduction in one's ability to perform physical activities, and reduce independence and overall health. Muscle mass loss occurs very quickly (i.e., within a few days) after surgery.

The investigators previous work has shown that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the thigh muscles on one side of the body can help maintain muscle mass and strength on the stimulated side after surgery. Since then, additional work has been carried out to find the most effective form of stimulation to build muscle.

The current study aims to use this refined stimulation protocol in a clinical trial on the wards after major abdominal surgery. The intervention will involve delivering stimulation to both thighs in the few days after surgery, so that the investigators can assess whether this stimulation can preserve muscle mass and strength, and also, patients' ability to perform physical activities after surgery.

The mode of transmission of H. pylori is through the fecal-oral or oral-oral routes.

Chronic gastritis has been linked to helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric lymphoma are all linked to this condition .

In Egypt, a high prevalence of H. pylori infections has been reported, ranging from 70% in the general population , 73% among school children , up to 88% in patients with chronic active HCV .

In 2007, the American College of Gastroenterology estimated that the cure rate for H. pylori infections was 70-85 percent with the use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole .

children with H. pylori infection do not have severe digestive symptoms. pylori infection represents a key factor in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer and chronic gastritis in children. In addition, H. pylori infection has also been reported to have extra-digestive consequences .

A recent comprehensive evaluation found that sequential and conventional triple treatment had a cure rate of 84% .

NCT06964282,IPB vs PENG Blocks Comparison on Analgesia and Recovery After THA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06964282,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background:

In recent years, regional anesthesia has become more popular because it can reduce pain and the need for strong pain medications like morphine. For hip surgery, the PENG block is already known to be effective. A newer method, called the iliopsoas plane block (IPB), is very similar and has also shown good results in hip arthroscopy. However, these two techniques have never been directly compared in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using the posterior approach.

Goal:

This study aims to see if the IPB is just as effective as the PENG block for controlling pain and helping patients recover well after hip replacement surgery.

Method:

118 adult patients scheduled for hip replacement under spinal anesthesia will be randomly assigned to receive either: IPB: 7 ml of Ropivacaine 7.5 mg/ml PENG: 14 ml of Ropivacaine 3.75 mg/ml Both injections are given under ultrasound guidance 30 minutes before spinal anesthesia. Neither the patient, the surgeon, nor the data collector will know which technique was used.

Post-Surgery Care:

All patients will receive standard pain relief, including:

Paracetamol every 6 hours Etoricoxib once a day Morphine via a patient-controlled pump for 48 hours

Main Outcome Measured:

The primary goal is to compare pain during movement 6 hours after surgery, using a pain scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). The study will consider the two blocks equivalent if the difference in average pain scores is less than 1 point.

Other Outcomes:

Total morphine used in 48 hours Pain scores at rest and during movement at various time points Walking ability (2- and 6-minute walk tests, and timed-up-and-go test) Quality of recovery (using the QoR-15 questionnaire) Side effects of morphine Patient satisfaction Length of hospital stay

Safety:

Both techniques are safe and already used in clinical practice. Ultrasound guidance minimizes risks like nerve injury, bleeding, or infection.

Conclusion:

If the IPB is shown to be as effective as the PENG block, both can be considered reliable options for pain control and early recovery after hip replacement surgery.",NO,Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)|Postoperative Pain Management|Peripheral Nerve Blocks|PENG Block|Iliopsoas Nerve Block,PROCEDURE: PENG Block|PROCEDURE: Iliopsoas nerve block,"Dynamic Pain 6h postoperative, Dynamic pain score (during mobilization) at 6 hours postoperatively, measured on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS).

NCT06964243,Protocol Assessment of Motor Cortex rTMS for Treating Neuropathic Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06964243,CSA3-RTMS,RECRUITING,"Neuropathic pain is frequent and drugs relieves only 50% of the patients. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at high frequency (HF, usually 10Hz) applied on the primary motor cortex (M1) is an effective treatment of neuropathic pain. For the treatment of chronic pain, the 'classical' HF-rTMS protocol (CHF-rTMS) include one daily session for one or two weeks as an induction phase of treatment followed by a weekly session to produce analgesic effects. However, another type of protocol is based on a more spaced repetition of HF-rTMS sessions (SHF-rTMS), including intervals of several days or weeks between two sessions, but also resulting in a significant pain relief. However, CHF-rTMS and SHF-rTMS have never been compared regarding their analgesic efficacy.

Alongside with pain, depression is the other clinical condition for which HF-rTMS is proposed as an effective therapeutic strategy. Another type of rTMS paradigm, called ""accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation"" (ACC-iTBS) protocol has been recently proposed for the treatment of depression, combining a high number of pulses delivered per session and a high number of short-duration sessions grouped into a few days of stimulation. However, this type of protocol has never been applied for the treatment of chronic pain patients.

Thus, for the first time we propose to compare in a pilot study the efficacy of three different rTMS protocols for the treatment of chronic neuropathic: CHF-rTMS, SHF-rTMS, and ACC-iTBS. In this study, two protocols two rTMS protocols (CHF-rTMS and ACC-iTBS) will share the same high total number of TMS pulses (i.e. 30 000 pulses) versus an rTMS protocol (SHF-rTMS) based on a lower total number of TMS pulses (i.e. 6 400 pulses), while one protocol (CHF-rTMS) will include a higher number of days of stimulation (i.e. 10 days) compared to the two other protocols (ACC-iTBS and SHF-rTMS) (i.e. 4 days). In all cases, the motor cortical target and the intensity of stimulation will the same.

Thus, this study will be able to appraise the respective influence of the number of pulses delivered (the higher the number, the greater the effect) and the number of sessions (the higher the number, the more restrictive the implementation of treatment).

NCT06964178,The Effect of Photodynamic Therapy on Post-extraction Third Molar,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06964178,,COMPLETED,"The extraction of lower third molars is one of the most frequent procedures in oral surgery. For this reason, the extraction of these teeth generally requires a surgical approach involving the elevation of a mucoperiosteal flap and osteotomy to allow the use of elevators and removal of tooth in pieces or as a whole depending on the situation. As a result, it is a more invasive procedure than simple dental extraction, which leads a more challenging healing period for the patient, with complications such as pain, swelling, and trismus. Literature studies suggest that the peak of pain reported by patients occurs 3-5 hours after the local anesthetic wears off, while swelling reaches its maximum in the first 24-48 hours before gradually decreasing. In the first hours following the surgery, in addition to symptom onset, reparative mechanisms begin, contributing to the healing of the post-extraction site. Independent of the use of bone grafts, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been introduced to enhance healing and for disinfection of the extraction site5,6. aPDT uses a non-thermal photochemical reaction which promotes the excitation of a nontoxic dye (photosensitizer) by light at an appropriate wavelength. This causes an interaction with molecular oxygen and acts by damaging biomolecules selectively and destroying bacterial membranes7. The efficacy of this therapy in reducing bacterial load has been demonstrated in literature, and it has been widely used in patients with periodontitis or peri-implantitis since several years8. Although the primary use of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy seems to be related to periodontal and peri-implant diseases, its use in oral surgery to disinfect the socket and reduce the risk of complications related to bacterial contamination of the surgical site should not be underestimated9. Furthermore, the biostimulator effect of the laser can promote tissue healing after surgery through vasodilation, activation of microcirculation, and enhancement of tissue metabolism, thus reducing the recovery time for the patient10. There are still a few papers in literature that evaluate the effect of aPDT on post-operative healing after wisdom tooth extractions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of aPDT on the healing of soft and hard tissues and on post-surgical discomfort in subjects undergoing mandibular third molar extraction. The null hypothesis is that aPDT has no beneficial effects compared to spontaneous healing.",NO,Photodynamic Therapy|Third Molar Extraction|Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy,DEVICE: Experimental: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) after extraction of third molar,"Probing Pocket Depth PPD Index, Probing depth is the distance from the gingival margin to the base of the pocket (mm), T0 (Baseline), T1(14 days after extraction) and T2 (3 month after extraction)","Recession REC Index, Recession is the apical shift of the marginal tissues associated with the attachment loss exposing the root or implant surface to the oral environment (mm), T0 (Baseline), T1(14 days after extraction) and T2 (3 month after extraction)|Clinical attachment level CAL Index, measured in mm as distance from the CEJ to the gingival margin (GM), T0 (Baseline), T1(14 days after extraction) and T2 (3 month after extraction)|Plaque Index, This index ascertains the thickness of plaque along the gingival margin (%), T0 (Baseline), T1(14 days after extraction) and T2 (3 month after extraction)|Bleeding on probing BOP Index, is an indicator of tissue inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens (%), T0 (Baseline), T1(14 days after extraction) and T2 (3 month after extraction)|Landry's healing index, (code 1 (very poor healing); • code 2 (poor healing); • code 3 (good healing) ; • code 4 (very good healing); • code 5 (excellent healing), T0 (Baseline), T1(14 days after extraction) and T2 (3 month after extraction)|Bone density Index, bone density through intraoral radiographs was also assessed through peri-apical x-rays at T2, attributing a value from 0 to 2.

It is conducted as part of a doctoral research project.

The intervention consists of three structured sessions delivered over three weeks, with additional online follow-ups. Each session lasts 1.5 hours and takes place in the evening, with a one-week interval between sessions.

Session 1 focuses on providing fundamental knowledge about sleep health. Session 2 introduces behavioral strategies to improve sleep health and asks participants to implement behavior change intentions.

Session 3 reviews the implementation of the intention, the changes made or not, and addresses the relationship between stress and sleep, along with coping strategies.

Participants are required to complete online questionnaires and a sleep diary at multiple time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and up to three months post-intervention. These assessments measure sleep habits, beliefs about sleep, and mental health indicators.

Participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups:

Intervention group, which receives the psychoeducational program first. Waitlist control group, which completes an additional follow-up before receiving the intervention.

The study design allows for a controlled evaluation of the intervention's impact on sleep-related behaviors and mental health outcomes.",NO,Psychoeducational|Psychoeducational Waitlist Control,BEHAVIORAL: Sleep health education,"RU-SATED, RU-SATED is the instrument used to measure sleep health. Sleep health varies according to individual, social and environmental conditions, and emphasises that good sleep is not simply the result of an absence of sleep disorders. In terms of its components, sleep health relates to (1) sleep duration, or the total number of hours of sleep obtained over 24 hours, (2) sleep efficiency, corresponding to the ease or otherwise with which an individual falls asleep and returns to sleep, and (3) timing, or how our sleep fits into a 24-hour day, (4) alertness, or sleepiness, which concerns a person's ability to maintain a state of attentive wakefulness throughout the day, (5) satisfaction, or subjectively represented sleep quality, and finally (6) sleep regularity.

More specifically, RU-SATED score is distributed between 0 and 12, with the higher the score, the better the person's sleep health., Intervention group: T0 (baseline), T1 (post 3 weeks intervention), T2 (3 months post-intervention). Waitlist control group: T0 (baseline), T1 (3 weeks later T0), T2 (post 3 weeks intervention), T3 (3 months post-intervention).|Sleep satisfaction, Self-reported assessment of overall sleep quality using daily sleep diary entries.

Since no standardized tools exist, items were developed based on prior research and theoretical guidelines. Validity was confirmed through factor analysis and internal consistency testing.

The instrument includes 7-point Likert scales measuring:

Attitudes (6 items) - Perceptions of sleep hygiene. Higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes.

Subjective norms (4 items) - Perceived social expectations. Higher scores reflect stronger norms.

Motivation to comply (4 items) - Importance given to others' opinions. Perceived control (4 items) - Confidence in maintaining good sleep habits. Intention (3 items) - Readiness to adopt healthy sleep behaviors. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of beliefs and behavioral influences., Intervention group: T0 (baseline), T1 (post 3 weeks intervention), T2 (3 months post-intervention). Waitlist control group: T0 (baseline), T1 (3 weeks later T0), T2 (post 3 weeks intervention), T3 (3 months post-intervention).|Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale, Sleep hygiene is measured by the Sleep hygiene practice scale (SHPS), which is an instrument that measures sleep hygiene including 4 domains: (1) factors related to the sleep-wake cycle (e.g. irregular bedtime/rising time, lack of exposure to outside light), (2) factors related to activation and activating behaviours (e.g. falling asleep watching television or listening to music, intense exercise in the 2 hours before going to sleep), (3) factors related to consumption and diet (e.g.going to bed hungry, drinking alcohol close to bedtime), and (4) factors related to the sleep environment (e.g. sleeping environment too noisy, too bright, too hot). The total score is distributed between 30 and 180, where the higher the score, the higher the frequency of poor sleep hygiene practices., Intervention group: T0 (baseline), T1 (post 3 weeks intervention), T2 (3 months post-intervention). Waitlist control group: T0 (baseline), T1 (3 weeks later T0), T2 (post 3 weeks intervention), T3 (3 months post-intervention).|Self-efficacy, This study evaluates self-efficacy in adopting, maintaining, and recovering sleep habits. Inspired by prior research, the instrument includes:

Adoption efficacy (2 items) - Confidence in changing sleep habits despite difficulties.

Maintenance efficacy (4 items) - Ability to sustain new sleep routines over time.

Recovery efficacy (3 items) - Capacity to resume habits after interruption. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = ""Completely false,"" 4 = ""Completely true"").

The range of scores is 2 to 8, 4 to 16 and 3 to 12 respectively. Higher scores indicate stronger self-efficacy in each domain., Intervention group: T0 (baseline), T1 (post 3 weeks intervention), T2 (3 months post-intervention). Waitlist control group: T0 (baseline), T1 (3 weeks later T0), T2 (post 3 weeks intervention), T3 (3 months post-intervention).","Perceived stress, Perceived stress is evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which measures how stressful life situations are perceived. This self-administered questionnaire consists of 14 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = ""Never"", 1 = ""Almost never"", 2 = ""Sometimes"", 3 = ""Fairly often"", 4 = ""Very often""). The total score ranges from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress. The PSS will be used to control for stress levels during evaluation phases, especially around exam periods, when participants are expected to report higher stress levels., Intervention group: T0 (baseline), T1 (post 3 weeks intervention), T2 (3 months post-intervention). Waitlist control group: T0 (baseline), T1 (3 weeks later T0), T2 (post 3 weeks intervention), T3 (3 months post-intervention).|Anxiety, Anxiety is evaluated using the GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale). This 7-item self-report tool assesses anxiety symptoms experienced over the past two weeks, such as feeling nervous, unable to control worries, or having difficulty relaxing. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, indicating the frequency of symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with thresholds at 5, 10, and 15 categorizing anxiety as mild, moderate, or severe. A score of 10 or higher is used to identify clinical levels of anxiety, which will be applied to distinguish students with clinically significant anxiety in this study., Intervention group: T0 (baseline), T1 (post 3 weeks intervention), T2 (3 months post-intervention). Waitlist control group: T0 (baseline), T1 (3 weeks later T0), T2 (post 3 weeks intervention), T3 (3 months post-intervention).|Depression, The PHQ-9 will assess students' depression levels, with scores ≥10 indicating clinical depression. This self-administered questionnaire evaluates the presence and severity of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks. It consists of nine items rated on a four-point Likert scale (0 = ""not at all"" to 3 = ""nearly every day""), resulting in a total score from 0 to 27. Severity thresholds are: minimal (1-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), and severe (20-27)., Intervention group: T0 (baseline), T1 (post 3 weeks intervention), T2 (3 months post-intervention). Waitlist control group: T0 (baseline), T1 (3 weeks later T0), T2 (post 3 weeks intervention), T3 (3 months post-intervention).|Insomnia Severity Index, The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) assesses nocturnal and daytime insomnia symptoms.

NCT06963983,Virtual Reality Rehabilitation for Shoulder Pathologies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06963983,,RECRUITING,"Most rehabilitation protocols require patients to train the affected limbs with high regularity, following repetitive cycles of exercises, in order to recover mobility and strength. Nonetheless, the repetitive nature of these exercises can demotivate patients leading to less intense and committed training, if not ending with a lack of compliance toward the prescribed exercises, ultimately leading to a suboptimal recovery. For this reason, several research groups are investigating solutions to help patients in this process, using robotic support or protocols assisted by virtual reality (VR).

Most of these studies have shown benefits, notably in the field of post-stroke rehabilitation, however numerous types of physical therapies have not been investigated yet. Therefore, the main goal of this study will be to explore if the combination of modern motion-tracking and VR can provide significant functional outcomes for the treatment of the most common upper limb pathologies. The investigators created a set of exergames designed to lead the patients through a gamified version of part of physiotherapy (PT). This modified therapy is expected to offer several benefits to the treatment with respect to a purely conventional therapy: (i) improved patient's motivation and commitment to the exercises; (ii) constant evaluation of the patient's performance, thanks to the use of motion tracking; (iii) session-by-session tuning of exercises difficulty; (iv) clear progress traceability; (v) real-time alerts in case of problematic or compensatory movements; (vi) measurement and evaluation of new metrics of movements quality that were not possible in conventional therapy setups.

NCT06963918,Expiratory Muscle Training and Trunk Flexion in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06963918,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Postural abnormalities involving the trunk are prevalent in over 20% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Pathological forward trunk flexion (FTF) is a drug-refractory complication in patients with PD leading to imbalance, pain and fall-related injuries. Deep abdominal muscle training is a key rehabilitation strategy for FTF, as muscles like the transversus abdominis and multifidus are crucial for lumbar stabilization. This training has been shown to improve body position and lumbar proprioception.

Abdominal muscles are also responsible for forced expiration. Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) utilizing forced expiration through expiratory trainer has emerged as a beneficial intervention in the non-pharmacological management of PD, positively impacting clinical aspects such as dysphagia, dystussia, hypokinetic dysarthria, and drooling. EMG study showed large abdominal muscles activity, particularly the transversus abdominis and internus obliquus abdominis during EMST. Therefore, EMST might also be effective in improving lumbar stabilization.

Given the established role of abdominal muscles in trunk stabilization, it is plausible that activation of deep abdominal muscles during EMST with the right level of resistance might improve FTF in PD patients. No studies have yet examined the effect of EMST on posture in PD.

This platform leverages eye-tracking technology to assess and potentially enhance cognitive functions, particularly attention and memory.

The diagnostic component of the study investigates the use of eye vergence responses-elicited during a visual attention task-as potential biomarkers for early AD. Specifically, the study will re-validate eye vergence by comparing response patterns among three groups: cognitively healthy older adults, individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and patients with confirmed AD, based on blood biomarkers (ßA40, ßA42, pTau181, and pTau217). The diagnostic task follows an oddball paradigm, where participants must detect target images (grapes) among distractors (other fruits) across 100 one-second trials, lasting approximately three minutes. Eye vergence is recorded using remote infrared eye-tracking, while participants simply fixate on a computer screen.

The therapeutic aspect evaluates the impact of BGaze Therapy, which employs ""serious games"" designed to train attentional control through eye movements. The game dynamically adjusts its difficulty in real time and provides continuous feedback to enhance user engagement and learning efficacy.

Participants will undergo pre-testing-including blood biomarker analysis and standardized cognitive assessments (MMSE and MoCA)-followed by a two-month training phase at care centers using the BGaze Therapy system. Post-intervention testing will mirror the pre-test protocol to assess cognitive and neurological changes.

A total of 60 participants (30 with MCI and 30 with AD) will be recruited for the validation phase. A subsample (15 MCI and 15 AD participants) will be selected for the treatment phase.

It happens when the body's immune system creates groups of proteins (called immune complexes) that build-up in the kidneys causing swelling (inflammation). Over time, this inflammation may lead to kidney damage and cause the kidneys to no longer work properly. The main aim of this study is to check how well mezagitamab changes protein levels in the urine (proteinuria) compared to placebo in adults with primary IgAN. A placebo looks like medicine but doesn't have any active ingredients in it. Other aims are to check how safe mezagitamab is and how well participants with primary IgAN can tolerate it compared to placebo, and to find out if and how well mezagitamab continues to maintain kidney function over the long term compared to placebo.

Participants will be placed in 1 of the 2 treatment groups; the main group and the open-label group. In the main group, participants will be placed in 1 of the 2 treatment groups by chance (either mezagitamab or placebo) at a 2:1 ratio. This means that out of 3 participants, 2 will receive mezagitamab and 1 will receive placebo. The participants will receive either mezagitamab or placebo for almost half a year in two 1-year cycles. They will be observed for another half year in each 1-year cycle and will have check-ups about every month during this time.

Measurement Tool Description:

The Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (QHI) is a smooth surface index that assesses dental plaque by staining the plaque with a disclosing agent and categorizing it into six grades based on severity:

Grade 0: No plaque present.

Grade 1: Isolated islands of plaque.

Grade 2: A clearly defined continuous plaque line at the gingival margin, extending up to 1 mm.

Grade 3: Plaque covering the cervical third of the tooth.

Grade 4: Plaque covering up to the middle third of the tooth.

Grade 5: Plaque extending beyond the middle third and reaching the incisal or occlusal edge.

Index Calculation:

QHI is calculated by summing the severity grades and dividing by the total number of teeth evaluated, as follows:

At present, timely and accessible early detection methods for tuberculosis are still a major obstacle. In this context, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), especially the AI-assisted chest X-ray (CXR) in the field of diagnostic imaging, has proved the potential to significantly improve the speed and accuracy of tuberculosis diagnosis. However, the extent to which these technologies can affect the broader tuberculosis care cascade, especially by reducing the diagnostic time in the population level, has not yet been explored. The proposed project plans to use the certified AI-assisted CXR system (JF CXR-1) for tuberculosis screening, which aims not only to integrate AI into the diagnosis process, but also to critically assess its impact on the overall tuberculosis care cascade. The selected location for this project is Yichang City in western Hubei Province, China, which is facing a high TB burden. The city has established a strong city-wide health big data platform ten years ago, providing the basis for this project. The project will first optimize the AI-assisted CXR system through retrospective imaging to validate the accuracy of case screening (Stage Ⅰ). Secondly, the project will shift its focus to the real world, where cluster randomized controlled trials will be conducted in primary-care settings (Stage Ⅱ). In this stage, the effectiveness of the AI-assisted CXR system in reducing the diagnostic time of TB cases will be evaluated by comparing with those settings without using the tool. In stage Ⅲ, the qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to evaluate the generalization, practicality, and feasibility of extending the screening strategy in various community environments. If the AI-assisted screening strategy is proven accurate, effective, and sustainable, it may pave the way for its widespread adoption in primary healthcare institutions and other grassroots areas in China. This can not only improve the timeliness of tuberculosis diagnosis, but also help to allocate medical resources more effectively and significantly reduce tuberculosis-related incidence and mortality, bringing positive changes to global public health. In addition, the results of the project can also provide information for policy decisions and guide the formulation of strategies to prioritize the integration of AI into health care, which can not only fight against tuberculosis but also a series of other diseases.",NO,Tuberculosis (TB),DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Artificial intelligence-assisted chest X-ray in TB screening|OTHER: Routine doctors analyze the process of chest X-rays,"The difference in the detection yield of pulmonary tuberculosis screening in township medical and health institutions between the intervention group and the control group., Detection yield = The number of people who visited the hospital for chest DR Examination and were ultimately determined to require further relevant examinations and were diagnosed in the tuberculosis specific disease reporting system/the number of people who underwent chest DR Examination, Baseline and 6 months","The difference in the average number of days from visiting township medical and health institutions to the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis between patients in the intervention group and the control group, The number of days for confirmed diagnosis = the time of diagnosis reported by the tuberculosis specific disease system - the time of the patient's visit, Baseline and 6 months|The differences in the accuracy of different tuberculosis screening strategies between the intervention group and the control group, The differences in the accuracy of different tuberculosis screening strategies between the intervention group and the control group, including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, Youden index, and AUC, Baseline and 6 months",,Xuelin Yang,"China Medical Board (CMB)|Yichang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China|JF Intelligent Healthcare Medical Technology Co",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,12000,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: SCREENING,CAMS&PUMC-IEC-2025-044|#24-564,2025-05-15,2027-12-31,2027-12-31,2025-05-09,,2025-05-09,,"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/06/NCT06963606/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

Treatment for blood clots is blood thinning medications, which if taken for a prolonged period of time can result in bleeding which further complicates treatment. We hope to gather information to better understand the factors associated with blood clot formation and management in the lower left chamber of the heart. This understanding will hopefully enable us and others to improve management of this condition in the future and therefore help the wider population.

Due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream, jaundiced babies appear yellow, which allows healthcare professionals to visually identify significantly jaundiced babies. They will be referred for a blood test to determine if the bilirubin level is so high that treatment such as phototherapy, or more intensive help is required. Left untreated or treatment delayed, jaundice can potentially result in serious brain damage and even death (rare). However, visual inspection of jaundiced babies is inaccurate, often need to unnecessary referrals to hospital blood tests. We have developed the ""neoSCB"" smartphone app, which accurately detects significant jaundice by taking photographs of the baby's sclera (white part of an eye) and analysing its yellowness using a diagnostic algorithm. The neoSCB app has previously been validated in Ghana involving over 700 newborn babies. In this new study, we will recruit 405 newborn babies with a range of jaundice levels to validate an optimised diagnostic algorithm following our latest research. Two existing commercial screening devices will also be used to investigate whether the app delivers a similar accuracy, at a fraction of the cost.

NCT06963242,Evaluating the Accuracy of Dynamic Navigation in Implant Surgery for Full Arch Prosthesis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06963242,,RECRUITING,"Study Objective:

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the Dynamic Navigation System in performing implant placement for full arch prosthesis rehabilitation. This system uses landmarks, including bone screws fixed to the bone (Group 1), and landmarks on remaining teeth to be extracted (Group 2), to accurately determine the placement of the implants

Participants:

Patients aged 18 and older, who have total tooth loss or partial tooth loss, and are candidates for full arch implant-supported prosthesis rehabilitation, are invited to participate, provided they meet the necessary health requirements for surgery.

Group 1: Patients who have total tooth loss or partial tooth loss but do not meet the following conditions:

1. Having at least 3 remaining teeth or roots with mobility no greater than grade 1, and
2. The remaining teeth are distributed with at least 1 tooth in the front and 1 tooth in the back on each side of the arch. These patients will have bone screws placed on the bone to serve as landmarks for implant placement using the dynamic navigation system.

Group 2: Patients who have at least 3 remaining teeth, all with mobility no greater than grade 1, and at least one tooth in the front and one in the back on each side of the arch. These teeth will serve as landmarks for implant placement.

Study Methodology:

Group 1: Patients who have total or partial tooth loss, and do not meet the conditions of having at least 3 remaining teeth with mobility no greater than grade 1, and having at least one tooth in the front and one in the back on each side, will have bone screws placed on the bone as landmarks for implant placement.

Group 2: Patients with at least 3 remaining teeth with mobility no greater than grade 1, and at least one tooth in the front and one in the back on each side, will use these teeth as landmarks for implant placement.

After surgery, the implant deviation from the planned implant data will be evaluated to assess the accuracy of implant placement.

Factors such as implant position deviation, surgery time, and complications will be evaluated to compare the effectiveness between the two groups.

Benefits and Risks:

1. Benefits:

   1. Improved accuracy in implant placement using the Dynamic Navigation System.
   2. Cost of using the Dynamic Navigation System and the cost of bone screws for patients without sufficient remaining teeth are covered by the study.
   3. Scientific contribution to improving implant placement methods for future patients.
2. Risks:

   1. Surgical risks including infection, pain, swelling, and potential implant failure, which can occur even without the use of the dynamic navigation system.
   2. Radiation exposure from imaging tests, particularly CBCT scans, will be required. The radiation exposure is minimal and within safe limits.
   3. Slight increase in surgery time, typically 2-5 minutes longer than traditional surgery, for preparation and calibration of the navigation system to ensure its proper functionality.

Its validity, reliability and responsiveness have been demonstrated, and it is regularly used in studies of children with unilateral CP.

The raw AHA scores (min: 22 to max: 88) will be covered to a logit scale from 0 to 100 in order to obtain an interval scale, a proprety that the raw scores do not have. The conversion to this scale is based on a Rasch model. An increase in the AHA score indicates an improvement in the child's hability to perform bimanual taks.

This study falls into the ""Balanced Advantages"" model of non-inferiority study designs. In this model, it is common to accept an inferiority level of 10 to 50% of the experimental treatment compared with the reference treatment. For this study, we set the accepted inferiority at -10% of the known values for the reference HABIT-ILE treatment; approximately 5 points., At the baseline (T0), at the end of the camp (T1: T0 + 21 + 2 days), and during the follow-up visit (T2: T0 + 90+2 days)","Canadian Measure of Occupational Performance (COPM), The Canadian Measure of Occupational Performance (COPM) will be used to define therapeutic goals, and to quantify the change in the child's performance and the parents' level of satisfaction for each functional goal. Using the COPM, the therapist conducts a semi-structured interview with the child's parent to identify difficulties in self-care, productivity, and leisure. The parent rates the importance of each indetified issue(1-10) and selects five priorities. For each, they rate their child's performance and their satisfaction with that performance (1-10, Higher ratings indicate greater importance, performance, and satisfaction). Average scores (out of 10) are calculated for performace and satisfaction. A change of two points or more is considered clinically significant.

For this secondary outcome, the assumption is a maximum non-inferiority of 10% (T2-T0), ie, 0.4 points on average for the COPM, based on the results of Arenada et al.., At the baseline (T0), at the end of the camp (T1: T0+ 21+2 days), and during the follow-up visit (T2: T0+ 90+2 days)|Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptative Test (PEDI-CAT), The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) will measure the change in functional skills in the domains of daily activities and mobility.

The main outcome will be the percentage of time spent performing movement during the sessions. The amount of activity performed at home out with sessions will also be measured in both groups., 4 days at home before T0, during the camp, 4days at home before T2|Changes of family resources: World health organization quality of life - Bref (WHOQOL-Bref), To complete the questionnaire and participate in the semi-structured interviews, families will be asked to designate the child's main carer, who will agree to participate in the entire study and complete the questionnaires and interviews alone.

The WHOQOL-Bref will measure parents' perceptions of their quality of life. This scale is derived from the WHOQOL-100 developed by the WHO (1995). It measures peopol's perception of their quality of life. The scale comprises 26 items divided into four areas: physical health, physiological health, social relationships end the environment. A hign score indicates a good quality of life, while a low score indicates a poorer quality of life. The 26 items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (scores from 1 to 5). It is possible to obtain a score in each of the 4 domains (average score). These domain scores must be multiplied by 4 to be comparable with the WHOQOL-100. Two items can be analysed separately., At the baseline (T0), at the end of the camp (T1: T0+ 21+2 days), and during the follow-up visit (T2: T0+ 90+2 days)|Changes of family resources: The Enabling Practice Scale (EPS), To complete the questionnaire and participate in the semi-structured interviews, families will be asked to designate the child's main carer, who will agree to participate in the entire study and complete the questionnaires and interviews alone.

The Enabling Practice Scale (EPS) will be used to assess the parents' perception of the nature of the support provided by the referral workers. The total score will be analysed, EPS assesses parets' perceptions of the nature of the support provided by professionals providing care. This is a self-questionnaire containing 24 questions, each of which is scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale (from 1 to 5). The minimu score is 24, the maximum 120. A higher score indicates a higher level of enabling. The PES can be completed in 5 to 10 minutes. The overall score will be used in this study., At the baseline (T0), at the end of the camp (T1: T0+ 21+2 days), and during the follo-up visit (T2: T0+90+2 days)|Changes of family resources: The Psychological Empowerment Scale (PES), The Psychological Scale (PES) will be used to estimate changes in family empowerment in 3 dimensions: attitudes of control and competence, knowledge and kno-how, and participation behaviours. The Psychological Empowerment Scale (PES) evaluates parent's power to act on the basis of 32 items divided into three dimensions: attitudes of control and competence, knowledge and know-how, and participation behaviours. Each item is scored from 1 to 5 (minimum total score: 32, maximum: 160). A higher score indicates a higher level of empowerment. The total empowerment score will be analysed., At the baseline (T0), at the end of the camp (T1: T0+ 21+2 days), and during the follow-up visit (T2: T0+ 90+2days)|Changes of family resources: The Parental Stress Inventory (PSI), The Parental Stress Inventory (PSI) will be used to measure the level of parental stress in the child's domain (eg, hyperactivity/distrac) ISP is a French translation of Abidin's Parental Stress Index (PSI). It measures the level of parental stress on the basis of 120 items belonging to two main categories: related to the child's domain: depression, feeling of competence, attachment, marital relationship, social isolation, parent's health, restrictions of the parent's role. The parent's answers are given on a likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5, and it is possible to obtain a total stress score (raw score or percentage) or 15 sub-scores representing the child's and parent's domains. The inventory has been validated for use with parents of children with disabilities., At the baseline (T0), at the end of the camp (T1: T0+ 21±2 days)), and during the follow-up visit (T2: T0+ 90±2 days)|Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA), PCERA measures the quality of the relationship between a parent and child aged 1 to 4.5 years. PCERA includes a total of 65 individual items composed of 29 parental, 28 child, and 8 dyadic items. The PCERA manual outlines six subscales: (1) Parent Positive Affective Involvement, Sensitivity, and Responsiveness; (2) Parent Negative Affect and Behavior; (3) Infant Positive Affect, Communication, and Social Skills; (4) Infant Dysregulation and Irritability; (5) Dyadic Mutuality and Reciprocity; and (6) Dyadic Tension. All items are coded into a three-point scale describing areas of concern (scores 1 and 2), areas of some concern (score 3) and areas of strength (scores 4 and 5). The overall minimum score is 65 and the maximal 325. Higher PCERA scores reflect more positive affect and/or behavior (subscales 1, 3 and 5). Consequently, higher scores on subscales 2, 4, and 6 indicate lower levels of negative affect and/or behavior., At the baseline (T0), at the end of the camp (T1: T0+ 21±2 days), and during the follow-up visit (T2: T0+ 90±2 days)|Parental representations: PARTNER programme, The impact of the PARTNER programme on parental representations of their child's disability and abilities will be assessed using semi-structured interviews. Changes in the parents' representations from before to after the programme will be assessed, and representations will be compared between each group with a sample of parents.

NCT06962800,A Study to Learn More About the Effects and Safety of Felzartamab Infusions in Adults With Primary Membranous Nephropathy (PMN),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06962800,PROMINENT,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In this study, researchers will learn more about the use of felzartamab in participants with primary membranous nephropathy, also known as PMN. In people with PMN, autoantibodies build up in the glomeruli of the kidney. Antibodies are proteins that help the body fight off infection. An autoantibody is a type of antibody that mistakenly targets and attacks the body's own tissues. Glomeruli are the filters of the kidney that remove waste and extra fluid from the body. In PMN, the build-up of autoantibodies in the glomeruli causes damage to the kidneys.

Kidney damage can lead to too much protein and blood leaking into the urine. High levels of protein in the urine, called proteinuria, are common in people with PMN. Symptoms of PMN can include swelling in the legs and body, tiredness, and high blood pressure. If left untreated, PMN can eventually lead to kidney failure.

In this study, researchers will learn more about how a study drug called felzartamab affects people with PMN. Felzartamab is a monoclonal antibody, which means it is an antibody made in a laboratory. Felzartamab can target immune cells that produce autoantibodies, helping to lower their buildup in the kidneys. The main goal of this study is to compare how felzartamab works compared to a drug called tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is another drug given to people with PMN and kidney disease.

The main question that researchers want to answer is:

* How many participants achieve a complete response after 104 weeks of treatment?
* A complete response means that their urine protein levels decrease to a low level and their kidney function remains stable.

Researchers will also learn about:

* How long it takes before the participants' disease gets worse
* How long the participants' urine protein levels stay low
* How many participants develop antibodies against felzartamab in the blood?
* How many participants achieve a complete response after 76 weeks of treatment
* How many participants have medical problems during the study
* How felzartamab is processed by the body
* How felzartamab affects participants' tiredness and overall physical health

The study will be done as follows:

* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study. This may take up to 42 days.
* Participants will be randomized to receive either felzartamab as intravenous (IV) infusions or tacrolimus, taken orally as tablets.
* If participants have worsening kidney function or worsening proteinuria, or if their PMN relapses, or if they show no signs of improvement in their PMN, they will have a chance to receive rescue treatment.
* If a participant stops treatment early, there will be follow-up visits every 12 weeks until they reach Week 104.
* In total, participants will have up to 23 study visits. Participants who do not need rescue treatment will stay in the study for up to 104 weeks.

NCT06962553,Nurses' Competence and Role in Survival Prediction and Prognostic Communication,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06962553,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"\[Background\] Nurses' roles in survival prediction and prognostic communication have historically been limited due to role delineation, lack of formal training, and cultural norms. In Taiwan and other cultural contexts, prognostic discussions have traditionally been the purview of physicians. However, evolving paradigms in health communication, practical realities in nursing practice, and the expanded responsibilities of advanced practice nurses have highlighted the importance of nurses in this domain. Nurses frequently engage in ""foreseeing"" prognostic indicators through daily patient care, and emerging evidence suggests their prognostic accuracy is often comparable to or exceeds that of physicians. Despite this, the exact scope of nurses' roles in prognostication remains unclear, creating gaps in understanding the contributions, benefits, and associating factors of nurses' involvement of prognostication process.

\[Aim\] This mixed-methods study aims to examine hospice nurses' competencies and roles in prognostication, with a focus on their survival prediction accuracy, confidence, influencing factors, and self-perceived responsibilities.

\[Method\] This three-year, cross-national study adopts an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. First, the quantitative phase utilizes a prospective cohort design, recruiting palliative nurses and physicians from ten palliative care sites across three countries. Eligible clinicians include nurses and physicians who provide care for patients with advanced cancer in palliative care settings or oncologic wards. Participating clinicians will provide weekly prognostic predictions for targeted patients and rate their confidence levels. Patients' demographic and disease-related information will also be collected to estimate survival using prediction tools. Data collection will conclude upon the patient's death or discharge. Based on the results of the quantitative phase, a descriptive qualitative study will be conducted to purposefully recruit nurses with varying levels of prediction accuracy and confidence from the quantitative phase. Semi-structured interviews will be carried out to gather qualitative data on their perspectives regarding prognostication, with a particular focus on their roles. The estimated sample size for quantitative phase is 152 nurse-physician dyads (based on 152 patients), while 20-30 nurses are expected to participate in the qualitative phase.

\[Data Analysis\] Descriptive statistics, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), Cohen's kappa, weighted kappa, McNemar's test, and ordinal logistic regression will be used to analyze quantitative data. Qualitative data will be analyzed using conventional content analysis. Nurses' Competence and Role in Survival Prediction and Prognostic Communication.

NCT06962319,Safety of Antimalarials in the FIRst trimEster,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06962319,SAFIRE,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The SAFIRE study aims to find effective treatments with acceptable safety for malaria in early pregnancy, a particularly sensitive time for the adverse consequences of malaria in pregnancy for both mother and baby. Currently, WHO recommends the antimalarial drug artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy. Other promising treatments are being rolled out in malaria-endemic countries for use in adults and children and data on current exposures in the first trimester are limited and insufficient to support a recommendation. This is due to the fact that pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials to protect fetuses, unintentionally depriving them of newer, potentially better treatments. Instead, they often received older, less effective drugs. The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH E21) and stringent regulatory authorities (e.g. EMA, FDA and MHRA) now encourage pregnant women to be included in well-designed studies to ensure they can safely benefit from medical advances.

This study will compare AL with the newer antimalarial drugs that have shown no significant safety concerns in laboratory studies, accidental use during early pregnancy, or trials in later pregnancy stages. The main goal is to see if these new drugs work as well as AL in treating malaria and are safe for the mother, her pregnancy and the developing baby. The newer antimalarials being tested also offer additional benefits to pregnant women, such as preventing new malaria infections for longer after treatment than the current standard treatment (AL). Also, they can be taken just once a day instead of twice daily, like AL. A simpler dosing schedule could improve adherence to the study medication, meaning women are more likely to take the full course of treatment as prescribed. This, in turn, enhances its effectiveness in real-world settings. Future antimalarials to be tested will include those with improved resistance profiles, offering more effective options for combating drug-resistant strains.

SAFIRE uses a special ""Bayesian Adaptive Platform Trial"" (APT) design. This open-ended approach allows researchers to add new interventions under the same protocol, leveraging the existing trial network with infrastructure. The use of a common protocol with innovative adaptive statistical design allows the trial to stop early if it becomes clear that the new drugs are unsafe.

This multi-centre trial will be conducted in several countries in Africa where malaria is very common. Women will be randomly assigned to receive either AL or one of the new treatments. Participants will be seen daily for 4 days, then weekly for 6 weeks to assess the response to treatment, and then monthly until delivery. Their health and outcomes will be closely monitored during and after pregnancy. Newborns will be followed for 6 months. An independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety data as it accumulates. By finding more treatment options, this study could improve care for pregnant women with malaria and lead to better health for mothers and babies in areas where malaria is widespread. The results will help inform global health policies and potentially change how we treat malaria in early pregnancy.",NO,"Malaria, Pregnancy|Malaria, Antepartum|Malaria (Uncomplicated)",DRUG: dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)|DRUG: Pyronaridine-artesunate (PA)|DRUG: Artemether-lumefantrine,"ACPR, PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) by Day 42, Day 42","Efficacy - ACPR Day 28, PCR-adjusted Adequate clinical and parasitological response by Day 28, Day 28","Primary safety endpoint - delivery, A composite endpoint of miscarriage, stillbirth, or major congenital anomalies, Delivery",Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,"Malaria Research and Training Center, Mali International Center of Excellence in Research, University of Sciences, Techniques, and Technologies of Bamako, Mali|KEMRI Centre for Global Health Research (CGHR), Kisumu, Kenya|Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro (CRUN), Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé|Medicines for Malaria Venture (co-sponsor)|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Parasitic Diseases & Malaria",FEMALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1510,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,24-036|MMV_SAFIRE_24_01,2025-07,2028-08,2029-08,2025-05-08,,2025-05-08,"Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro (CRUN), Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé, Direction Régionale de l'Ouest (IRSS-DRO), Nanoro, Burkina Faso|KEMRI Centre for Global Health Research (CGHR), Kisumu, 40100, Kenya|Malaria Research and Training Center, University of Sciences, Techniques, and Technologies of Bamako (USTTB),, Bamako, 1805, Mali",

NCT06962293,Magnetic Guided Counetrtraction During Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06962293,,RECRUITING,"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a technique that allows curative treatment of early gastrointestinal neoplasia with organ preservation. However, it is a technically demanding procedure. Tissue traction plays a vital role in facilitating the visualization of the cutting line and the submucosal vessels, which usually only relies on the hood attached to the tip of the endoscope. However, when dealing with flat or large lesions, the absence of reliable traction in ESD contributes to its technical complexity and prolongs procedure duration. Various traction devices and techniques have been developed to provide tension for the dissection plane and optimal visibility during ESD. Most of these only provide static traction from a fixed angle, thus the effect of traction diminishes when the dissection continues.

In contrast to the aforementioned traction methods, magnetic traction offers the ability to externally manipulate an internal magnetic retractor, simplifying the internal workspace. The proposed magnetic retractor is composed of a detachable clip from an hemoclip is affixed to a magnetic element. By adjusting the position of the external magnetic source, the magnetic retractor automatically couples and aligns with it, enabling simultaneous dynamic directional control during the ongoing ESD operation. A novel robotic magnetic countertraction system was developed (MAG-ESD). The system consists of two sections: an external permanent magnetic source and the disposable magnetic retractor. The external permanent magnetic source is composed by a large external permanent magnet (EPM) which held by robot arm to externally control the locomotion of the magnetic retractor within patient. The disposable magnetic retractor is a consumable surgical instrument that modified from a commercial hemoclip, which has small magnets hangs on the clip legs. The design of the disposable magnetic retractor eliminates the need for endoscope withdrawal which can be inserted through the instrument channel from the handle during ESD operations, like other common instruments.

According to WHO, cesarean section accounts for more than 1 in 5 (21%) of all births, and it is predicted that approximately one-third (29%) of births will be by cesarean section by 2030. Although cesarean section is a vital and life-saving surgery, it can unnecessarily put mothers and babies at risk for short- and long-term health problems when performed without a medical necessity. Unintended perioperative hypothermia, defined as the inadvertent lowering of core temperature below 36°C during surgery, is a well-known complication of anesthesia. Hypothermia can increase the risk of infection by suppressing the immune system, prolonging the recovery process, and triggering postpartum complications. Maintaining maternal body temperature during cesarean section helps reduce postoperative complications, reduce the risk of infection, and accelerate the recovery process. It is also critical for the health of the baby. Keeping the newborn's body temperature stable can help minimize risks such as hypoxia at birth. However, there are increasing studies showing that temperature control is not only limited to maternal health but also has serious effects on the baby after birth.

Among these, nearly 90% of ACTH-dependent CS are due to pituitary-dependent CS, known as Cushing disease (CD). The management of ACTH-dependent CS relies on distinguishing Cushing disease (or Corticotropinoma) from ectopic Cushing syndrome (ECS) followed by localization of the tumor in the sella. The diagnosis of CD is very challenging, especially when they are microadenomas (\<6 mm). Current imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have limitations in accurately delineating (sensitivity 60%) these tumors. Even if the lesion is detected inside the pituitary, the functionality of the tumor is questionable, as there can be innocent pituitary tumors which actually are not the cause of Cushing syndrome in a particular case. The diagnosis gets more complex with the fact that 10% of the ECS cases are reported to have an incidental non-functioning pituitary tumor, this can complicate the diagnosis of ECS. Though the localizing accuracy of BIPSS is 90%, the lateralization (40-70%) of corticotropinoma (whether the lesion is located on the right or left side) based on BIPSS is still questionable. These challenges contribute to the fact that in approximately 30% of cases of CD, the source of ACTH excess remains occult. The lack of information on accurate localization and lateralization of corticotropinoma leads to reduced remission rates after surgery. Therefore, novel approaches to diagnosing Cushing disease are needed.

We have developed a novel radiopharmaceutical \[68Ga\] Ga-DOTA-mDesmo. This radiopharmaceutical has the potential to selectively target the overexpressed V1b receptors in patients diagnosed with Cushing disease. The clinical studies demonstrated 100% diagnostic accuracy of \[68Ga\] Ga-DOTA-mDesmo PET/CT in delineating corticotropinomas, surpassing the accuracy of CE-MRI and BIPSS, regardless of adenoma size. However, the small sample size and regional patient recruitment may affect the generalizability of the results.

The project aims to assess the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of \[68Ga\] Ga-DOTA-mDesmo in a diverse Cushing syndrome population.

NCT06962163,"Prospective Phase 0 Pilot Study, Assessing Potential Interest of [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor PET/CT in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06962163,EXIGENCE,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive type of breast cancer that is difficult to treat. Unlike other forms of breast cancer, TNBC tends to relapse earlier and spread more quickly to other parts of the body. Unfortunately, patients with TNBC have a lower survival rate, often less than five years after diagnosis. This highlights the urgent need for better treatments for TNBC.

One of the main challenges in treating TNBC is that it lacks certain receptors that other breast cancers have. These receptors are usually targeted by specific therapies, making TNBC harder to treat with targeted approaches.

Currently, a type of imaging called \[18F\]FDG PET/CT is the most accurate method for detecting breast cancer and its spread. However, with the rise of personalized medicine, there is a growing interest in molecular targeted approaches. These methods aim to provide highly specific diagnostics and treatments based on the unique characteristics of each patient's cancer.

One promising target for these new approaches is a receptor called CXCR4. CXCR4 is found on the surface of many cells and is involved in various processes in the body. It is often overexpressed in different types of cancer, including breast cancer. Research has shown that CXCR4 levels are higher in metastatic sites (where cancer has spread) compared to primary tumors. CXCR4 is not only present in cancer cells but also in immune cells within the tumor environment.

In invasive breast cancer, CXCR4 plays a crucial role in tumor migration, invasiveness, metastasis, and proliferation. A clinical study evaluated 18 breast cancer patients using a new imaging method called \[68Ga\]Ga-PentixaFor PET/CT or PET/MR. They found that this method showed higher uptake in breast cancer cases with poorer prognosis compared to the traditional \[18F\]FDG PET/CT. Higher CXCR4 expression is particularly seen in TNBC compared to other breast cancer subtypes.

NCT06962046,Can the Use of Virtual Reality Improve TKA Outcomes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06962046,VR-TKA,RECRUITING,"Virtual reality (VR) uses computer technology to create a three-dimensional environment which the user can explore and interact with. VR can be used to distract the patient during an operation and has been used to avoid sedative premedication, increase patient satisfaction and decrease pain during nerve blocks. VR used alongside spinal anaesthetic for hip, knee and ankle operations has shown a trend of less sedation being required with no decrease in patient satisfaction.

The most common type of anaesthesia given during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is spinal. Spinal anaesthesia is given unless there are complications or other conditions present, and general anaesthesia is given instead. General anaesthesia puts the patient to sleep during the operation, whereas spinal anaesthesia allows the patient to stay awake, but numbs the lower half of the body so no pain is felt. Sedation is usually given with spinal anaesthesia to make the patient relaxed and sleepy. Light sedation will allow the patient to be awake but relaxed, whereas deeper sedation means the patient is more likely to be asleep and less likely to recall what happened during the operation. Sedation can cause a number of side effects including nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, pain, confusion, memory loss and breathing difficulties.

In this study, all patients will receive spinal anaesthesia. Group 1 will receive VR and a light level of sedation, whilst Group 2 will not receive VR but will receive a deeper level of sedation (standard of care). When using VR during TKA, a lighter level of sedation should be required. This could help to reduce side effects and aid quicker patient recovery.

While aTMS is quick to deliver, a standard session lasting 10-20 minutes, this schedule is time intensive for patients. It often requires time off from work to accommodate daily driving time to and from the clinic as well as treatment time.

The study will follow a randomized controlled trial design, incorporating clinical observation, analysis of biochemical markers, and assessment of physical and functional parameters. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) Group 1, receiving no protein supplementation (control group), (2) Group 2, receiving a single dose of protein supplement and (3) Group 3, receiving a double dose of protein supplement. The intervention will last for at least six weeks or until the biochemical markers of albumin normalize and the patient resumes regular oral intake. Biochemical assessment with be conducted through regular nutritional evaluations including measurement of serum albumin, prealbumin, C - reactive protein, creatinine, blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), urea, electrolytes, urine albumin and additional inflammatory markers. Bone density will be assessed using DEXA, MBSR and hip measurements to determine the potential improvements resulting from the intervention. Muscle mass will be evaluated using whole - body DEXA analysis, while muscle strength and mobility will be assessed through grip strength tests and fine gait assessments. Functional recovery will be evaluated usings standardized tools for activities of daily living (Barthel Index), mental state (Geriatric Depression Scale) and quality of life (SF - 36), as well as mobility and walking tests such as the Timed Up and Go Test and 6 - Minute Walk Test. The collected data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical tools, including comparison models (ANOVA, Mann - Whitney U test) and correlation models (Pearson - Spearman). This research is expected to enhance theoretical knowledge regarding the relationship between nutrition, biochemical markers and rehabilitation outcomes in stroke patients with hypoalbuminemia. More specifically, it aims to explore the underlying mechanisms through which nutrition affects recovery - a field that remains unexplored. Additionally, the anticipated finding may contribute to the development of clinical guidelines and therapeutic approaches for the nutritional management of patients with low albumin levels, promoting personalized nutritional strategies that support effective post - stroke rehabilitation.",NO,Stroke|Hypoalbuminemia|Sarcopenia|Osteopenia|Malnutrition (Calorie)|Protein-energy Malnutrition|Functional Decline,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Dietary Supplement,"Serum Albumin Levels, Change in serum albumin concentration to assess nutritional status and response to protein supplementation., Baseline and every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks","Muscle Mass (Whole-body DEXA), Evaluation of changes in muscle mass using DEXA scan., Baseline and at week 6",,University of Ioannina,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,100,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,University of Ioannina,2025-05-05,2030-05-05,2030-05-05,2025-05-08,,2025-05-08,"University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, 4500, Greece",

Goals of the prospective obeservational study:

1. To validate a new, comprehensive, multifactorial screeningsintrument to predict the risk on falls in community dwelling, Belgian, older adults (\>65years or older).
2. To optimize the new, comprehensive, multifactorial screeningsintrument and to specify correct cut off scores

Researchers will compare the data of the accuracy of new algorithm with the current Belgian policy.

Participants will participate in a one-time testing moment, where they will be asked some questions about general characteristics and medical history, followed by two questionnaire and seven physical tests . Based on this data, their fall risk will be assessed. In the year that follows, the older person's fall behavior will be monitored with a monthly falls calender.

The main research questions are:

* Does a preoperative VR mindfulness intervention reduce anxiety before surgery?
* Does this reduction in anxiety result in lower postoperative pain compared to usual care?
* Does the intervention help prevent chronic pain two weeks after surgery? Researchers will compare a VR mindfulness intervention group with a treatment-as-usual (TAU) group to assess the intervention's effectiveness.

Participants will:

* Be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

  * Experimental group: Receive a VR mindfulness session on the first day of hospitalization (one day before surgery).
  * Control group: Receive standard hospital care (no intervention).
* Complete psychological and pain assessments at four time points:

  1. Before the intervention (Day 1)
  2. Immediately after the intervention (only the experimental group, Day 1)
  3. After surgery (Day 2)
  4. Two weeks after surgery (follow-up)

These fractures are common in older adults and can significantly impact mobility, independence, and quality of life. There is currently no clear evidence to determine which treatment is better for this population. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does surgery or conservative collar treatment lead to better improvement in daily living, measured by the Barthel Index, after 12 weeks?
* What are the differences in pain, disability, and quality of life between the two treatments?

The study team will compare patients who receive surgical stabilization with those who are treated with a rigid cervical collar to see which approach supports better functional outcomes and healing.

Participants will:

* be randomly assigned to either surgery (posterior C1-C2 screw-rod fixation) or conservative collar treatment
* attend study visits at 12 weeks and 6 months
* complete questionnaires on daily functioning, pain, and quality of life
* undergo CT scans and other medical assessments
* record collar use (for conservative group) in a diary
* be monitored for any complications or changes in treatment (including crossover to surgery if needed)

NCT06961474,Effectiveness of Treatments for Cirrhosis With Varicose Veins,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06961474,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Liver cirrhosis is the fifth leading cause of death among adults, characterized by diffuse fibrous tissue proliferation and the formation of regenerative nodules and false lobules on the basis of widespread hepatocyte necrosis, leading to severe complications such as portal hypertension and liver failure. Cirrhosis is categorized into compensated and decompensated stages based on the presence or absence of clinical events such as ascites, variceal rupture bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have a significantly shorter median survival time compared to those in the compensated stage. Esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is a common life-threatening complication in patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, with high incidence rates and mortality. Current preventive and therapeutic approaches for variceal bleeding include pharmacological therapy, endoscopic treatment, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical interventions. However, mortality remains high, and each treatment modality has its own limitations and controversies.

This study aims to prospectively investigate the clinical characteristics of portal hypertension caused by various etiologies (e.g., hepatitis B, autoimmune diseases, schistosomiasis) and to compare the efficacy and safety of endoscopic and interventional treatments for varices, providing evidence-based medical support for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The study includes patients admitted for portal hypertension-related esophagogastric varices from February 2022 to December 2024, excluding those under 18 years of age, without varices, or with incomplete medical records. Baseline data, including demographic features, medical history, laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and Child-Pugh classification, will be collected. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months post-treatment to monitor adverse events (e.g., rebleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites) and survival status. The primary endpoint is the rebleeding rate within one year, while secondary endpoints include mortality and the incidence of portal hypertension-related complications.

With the acceleration of population aging in China and the increasing demand for sports brought about by the improvement of economic standards, rotator cuff tears have gradually become a significant social health problem that cannot be ignored. Currently, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is the standard treatment for rotator cuff tears. However, studies have shown that the average re-tear rate after rotator cuff repair surgery is 26.6%, which can be as high as 95% for massive rotator cuff tears. Therefore, how to prevent the occurrence of re-tears after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and improve surgical outcomes has become a hot spot for research in the field of shoulder arthroscopy. Based on previous clinical experience, our team developed an M-shaped suture technique for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Clinical observations have shown that the re-tear rate at one-year post-surgery is 8%, which is significantly lower than what has been reported in the literature. However, there is currently a lack of comparative studies on the efficacy of this technique versus traditional single-row and double-row suture techniques. Moreover, the current research evidence on the prognostic factors affecting rotator cuff repair surgery is conflicting, and there is still a lack of high-quality cohort studies to screen for risk factors for poor prognosis. This project aims to establish a high-quality ambispective cohort for minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery for rotator cuff tears, to compare the clinical efficacy of the M-shaped suture technique with traditional techniques, and to identify risk factors related to the prognosis after rotator cuff repair surgery. This will provide high-quality, real-world evidence to optimize the new suture technique and develop a clinical prediction model for re-tears after rotator cuff suture repair. In the long term, the project will conduct embedded intervention studies to address modifiable risk factors (including lifestyle interventions and optimization of rehabilitation protocols) and verify whether these interventions can enhance prognostic outcomes, so as to better develop a more scientific and rational management and treatment plan for patients with rotator cuff tears.

NCT06961240,THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINED WITH PRE-MEASURED NUMERICAL DATA IN PREDICTION OF DIFFICULT INTUBATION,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06961240,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model to predict difficult intubation in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Since patients are apneic during intubation without spontaneous breathing efforts, minimizing apnea duration is critical. Traditional methods for predicting difficult intubation rely on physical markers such as sternomental distance, thyromental distance, mouth opening, neck extension, Mallampati score, neck circumference, and upper lip bite test. However, performing these assessments quickly and objectively in every patient is challenging. Therefore, utilizing computer-assisted imaging systems and AI techniques may facilitate clinical practice.

In this study, 250 patients presenting to the anesthesia outpatient clinic, who provide informed consent, will be evaluated. Demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, body mass index) will be recorded. Measurements including mouth opening, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, and neck circumference will be performed. Additionally, Mallampati score, neck extension ability, and upper lip bite test results will be noted. Portrait photographs capturing shoulder and upper body anatomy from multiple angles will be taken. During the operation, the Cormack-Lehane score observed by anesthesiologists with at least three years of experience during intubation will also be recorded.

The collected data will consist of both tabular (structured) data and visual data. Data preprocessing will involve cleaning missing and outlier values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing continuous variables. Key anatomical points (e.g., chin tip, thyroid notch, sternum) will be identified using landmark detection algorithms on the images.

Of the dataset, 200 patients will be used for model training and 50 patients for testing. Machine learning methods (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting) and deep learning methods (Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks) will be employed. Tabular and image data will first be modeled separately and then combined using ensemble methods. Model performance will be evaluated with metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.

The models will be developed using Python programming language with libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and NumPy, supported by GPU-based computing.

This study is unique in its aim to compare classical physical examination-based predictions with AI-based predictions, enhancing the accuracy of difficult intubation forecasts. Strengthening clinical decision-making processes and improving patient safety are among the primary goals.

NCT06961227,Effectiveness of Ventilation Modes in Intensive Care: A Comparison of Mandatory Minute Ventilation and Synchronized Intermittant Mandatory Ventilation Using Bioelectrical Impedance Tomography,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06961227,,RECRUITING,"Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) is a commonly used ventilatory mode available in many modern ventilators, frequently applied in intensive care units for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. SIMV delivers a preset tidal volume or pressure at a predetermined respiratory rate and synchronizes with the patient's spontaneous breathing efforts, thereby enhancing patient-ventilator interaction and contributing to rehabilitation.

Mandatory Minute Ventilation (MMV) is a hybrid mode combining features of SIMV and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV), guaranteeing a preset minute ventilation (tidal volume × respiratory rate). It synchronizes support based on the patient's spontaneous efforts and compensates in cases of insufficient minute ventilation.

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging technique that enables real-time monitoring of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion by applying alternating electrical currents through surface electrodes. EIT has demonstrated strong correlation with findings from computed tomography, nitrogen washout, PET, and SPECT imaging modalities.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of MMV compared to SIMV in mechanically ventilated, hemodynamically stable adult patients (\>18 years old) in the intensive care unit. Patients must not require vasopressors, have a FiO₂ ≤ 60%, PEEP ≤ 8 cmH₂O, or receive neuromuscular blocking agents.

Patients will be monitored under both SIMV and MMV modes, separated by a 12-hour interval. To minimize carry-over effects, a one-hour washout period will be implemented before data collection with EIT. Key parameters including PO₂/FiO₂ ratio, PaCO₂, and EtCO₂ will be assessed.

Ischemic heart disease mainly refers to coronary artery stenosis or obstruction caused by coronary artery atherosclerosis leading to myocardial ischemia heart disease, called coronary heart disease. ""China Cardiovascular Health and Disease Report 2022"" mentioned that coronary heart disease is an important cardiovascular disease affecting the health of Chinese residents, and its prevalence and mortality are on the rise. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and interventional therapy (PCI) are commonly used in the treatment of coronary heart disease. CABG surgery can significantly reduce the recurrence of angina pectoris, the incidence of acute myocardial infarction and improve the survival rate of patients, the patency rate of 5 years after mammary arterial bridge can reach more than 90%. Current guidelines and various RCT studies have shown that CABG is the gold standard for revascularization in patients with complex coronary artery disease. With the increasing aging of Chinese population, there are more and more cases of complex coronary artery diseases, and CABG, as the first choice for complex coronary artery diseases, will be more and more widely used in the foreseeable future. At present, the number of coronary artery bypass surgery is on the rise, about 50,000 cases per year.

With advancing age, this condition is often associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Often, the inflammaging state is characterized by environmental factors, such as pollution, diet, and physical inactivity, as well as the accumulation of free radicals and alteration of the gut microbiota. Inflammaging also appears to be linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, and is related to low-grade mucosal inflammation, which may contribute to visceral hypersensitivity and symptom severity.In addition, cytokine activity and alterations in intestinal immune cells would appear to participate significantly in the pathogenesis of IBS. Additionally, there is an independent correlation between IBS and a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Given the multifactorial nature of IBS, no effective treatment has been identified to date. However, considering the central role that alteration of the gut microbiota plays in IBS, the use of prebiotics and probiotics may represent an alternative therapy, as well as help in managing the inflammatory state.

NCT06960811,Epileptic Psychoses and Their Link With Ictal Emotions and Consciousness,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960811,ASPAIC,RECRUITING,"Background :

Psychiatric comorbidities are common in epilepsy, affecting 50 to 70% of patients, especially when the epilepsy is focal and drug-resistant. Among these comorbidities, psychotic disorders (involving hallucinations and delusions) affect 8% of patients - that is, eight times more frequently than in the general population. Currently, the links between epilepsy and psychotic disorders are poorly understood and often overlooked by physicians, which impacts the mental health care of patients with epilepsy and leads to underdiagnosis.

The aim of this research is to determine whether there are differences in epileptic symptoms between patients with a psychotic comorbidity and those without.

Study design :

The main objective of this research is to better understand whether certain emotional epileptic symptoms are associated with a higher risk of developing psychotic symptoms.

The secondary objectives of this study are to investigate whether the level of consciousness during seizures is associated with a higher risk of developing psychotic symptoms.

To meet these objectives, we aim to include patients who, like you, (1) have epilepsy, (2) were hospitalized in the video-EEG unit of the Neurology Department at Central Hospital for seizure recording, and (3) underwent a psychiatric evaluation in the context of epilepsy between January 1, 2016, and April 1, 2025.

The study will take place at the University Hospital Center (CHRU) of Nancy, in the Neurology Department, within the video-EEG unit led by Professor Louis Maillard. The research will involve comparing epileptic symptoms between the group of patients without psychosis and the group of patients with psychosis.

Data collection will cover the five days of video-EEG hospitalization, along with information from the psychiatric evaluation, for a total duration of approximately one week per year.

Information for participants:

As part of your routine medical care, data is collected in your medical record to ensure appropriate follow-up. For the purposes of this research, we would like to collect certain data from your medical record.

NCT06960759,Mechanisms of Change in Behavioral Cough Suppression Therapy for Refractory Chronic Cough,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960759,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This study is testing new ways to help people who have chronic cough that has not improved with typical treatments. One approach is called behavioral cough suppression (BCS) therapy, which teaches people techniques to stop themselves from coughing. Another approach uses capsaicin, the substance that makes chili peppers hot, to help reduce the body's sensitivity to cough triggers.

In this study, we will test three treatments:

* BCS therapy with capsaicin (BCS+CAP),
* BCS therapy with a placebo (BCS+Sham),
* Capsaicin stimulation alone (CAP).

We will enroll 150 adults with chronic cough and randomly assign them to one of the three treatments. Each person will attend 12 treatment sessions.

We want to find out how these treatments affect:

* How sensitive someone is to things that make them cough,
* How well they can hold back a cough when they try,
* How their brain responds to things that cause an urge-to-cough,
* And how much their coughing affects their quality of life.

We believe all treatments may reduce sensitivity to cough stimulants, but BCS treatments will also improve how people sense and control the urge to cough.

To achieve this goal, the primary objective is to enhance the understanding of how biological, psychological, and social factors interact to influence readiness for behavior change around resistance exercise in this unique population. The Investigators primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering the Strength After Breast Cancer (SABC) program, focusing on how socioeconomic status (SES) and AL influence adherence and dropout rates. The Investigators will also further examine how self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and social support influence behavior change related to resistance exercise participation. The central hypothesis is that participants with lower SES will report geographic or financial constraints, receive reduced support from family or peers, have low confidence in their ability to exercise, and demonstrate lower adherence rates.

NCT06960408,"Effects of Sleep Hygiene Education and Progressive Relaxation Exercise on Anxiety, Sleep Quality and Glycemic Control in Diabetic Patients",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960408,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In diabetic patients, effective glycemic control is important in preventing complications, mortality and morbidity. The main purpose of DM treatment is to prevent neuropathic and vascular complications and to increase quality of life by keeping blood glucose levels and insulin activity within normal limits. It is stated that achieving the targeted glycemic control in diabetic patients reduces the risk of developing vascular complications in patients. In these patients, helping them reach the targeted glycemic level with lifestyle changes or medications is important in preventing the effects of diabetes on individual and community health. In effective DM monitoring and treatment, medical nutrition therapy (MNT), physical activity, drug therapy (OAD and insulin), DM education, patient self-monitoring and ensuring compliance with treatment are important. Although there have been significant developments in the field of treatment and follow-up today, there may be difficulties in achieving the targeted treatment goals in diabetic patients. This situation has led to the investigation of modifiable and non-modifiable factors affecting glycemic control in diabetic patients. Especially in Type 2 Diabetes, if these modifiable factors are diagnosed and managed early, effective management and control of diabetes can be achieved to a great extent. Especially psychological health and sleep health have become one of the new and mandatory modifiable risk factors for glycemic control in DM patients. Although it is known that diabetes is basically a disorder of the endocrine system, it has also been revealed that there is a relationship between psychosocial health and diabetes. Especially the presence of anxiety can cause an increase in blood glucose in diabetic patients, further worsening the patient's condition.Because emotional tension affects both neuroendocrine and hormonal pathways and indirectly the treatment and monitoring of diabetes, leading to blood sugar disorders. It is known that epinephrine secretion is stimulated by anxiety, which reduces the effect of insulin. Even in the simplest psychosocial stress and spiritual conflict, free fatty acids, cortisol and blood sugar increase. Therefore, stress and anxiety are considered important factors in patients whose blood sugar cannot be regulated despite medical treatment. In such cases, psychosocial evaluation should be made before increasing the insulin dose. In addition, studies in the literature show that in addition to the effect of anxiety on glycemic control, poor glycemic control also has an effect on the emergence of anxiety and a positive mutual relationship has been found between anxiety and glycemic control. Therefore, it was emphasized that anxiety and depression levels should be determined in order to consider diabetic patients as a whole. Sleep is a biological requirement and a physiologically active process. It repairs the body by giving strength to the mind and memory. Sleep quality is defined as the efficiency of sleep. Within the scope of sleep quality; sleep efficiency, number of sleep interruptions, total sleep duration, wakefulness duration, sleep transition time and spontaneous awakenings. Sleep, in addition to productivity and efficiency, positively affects cognitive functions such as memory and concentration, and contributes to physical and psychological renewal. Due to such positive effects, sleep is seen as an important variable affecting the individual's quality of life and well-being. Therefore, disruptions that may occur in sleep quality and sleep patterns cause problems such as inability to concentrate, anxiety, depression, increased sensitivity to pain, irritability, hallucinations, loss of appetite and difficulty in excretion, and directly affect the individual's daily life and general health. Therefore, it is important to take sleep health into consideration in order to ensure glycemic control in DM patients.

NCT06960343,Long Term Clinical Outcome After Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Augmentation With Autologous Microfragmented Lipoaspirate Tissue,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960343,,RECRUITING,"Specific Aims :

The aim of this prospective randomized controlled single-blind clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous microfragmented lipoaspirate tissue in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

The primary goal of this study was to test the following hypothesis: an intraoperative injection of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue processed with an enzyme-free technology could improve the clinical outcomes of single-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in terms of points in the Constant-Murley score (CMS) collected at least 5 years after surgery.

Background and Significance:

Rotator cuff surgery was initially proposed at the end of the 19th century and evolved then from open to arthroscopic techniques, rising quickly from a minor niche to a fully recognized subspecialty.

To improve clinical and functional results and reduce the retear rate, new fixation techniques and biological solutions to enhance tendon healing are being developed at a fast pace, as shown by the dramatic increase in the number of articles published per year.

Biological solutions to enhance rotator cuff healing include growth factors and platelet-rich plasma, as well as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their derivatives.

MSCs are believed to enhance tissue healing mainly through stimulation of local cells via paracrine mechanisms and anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory activity, thus creating a suitable microenvironment for tissue repair.

Autologous microfragmented lipoaspirate tissue has been recently introduced in orthopaedics as an easily available source of adipose derived MSCs (ADSCs) to support and accelerate tissue regeneration. Lipoaspirates contain human ADSCs and produce growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor, which play important regulatory roles in cellular functions, including adhesion, chemotaxis, proliferation, migration, matrix synthesis, differentiation, and angiogenesis.

Herewith, autologous microfragmented lipoaspirate tissue is expected to optimize the microenvironment for tendon regeneration. Among many approaches, devices relying on nonenzymatic methods and avoiding the use of additives and other additional manipulations (eg, centrifugation) allow one to harvest, process, and obtain autologous microfragmented lipoaspirate tissue directly in the operative theatre under sterile conditions. This permits immediate use in the same surgical intervention without delays owing to the difficulty of an ex vivo cell expansion and the complexity of the current good manufacturing practice requirements for preparing cells for therapeutic use.

Although several animal studies have been published showing promising results for the use of ADSCs in enhancing the healing of rotator cuff tears, minimal evidence describing augmentation of rotator cuff treatment with lipoaspirate.

Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:

This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial and represents the final follow-up of an our previous study with short follow-up (2 years). The previous study demonstrated that the intraoperative injection of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue is safe and effective in improving short-term clinical and functional results after single-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Nevertheless, no significant differences emerged between the groups in terms of rerupture rate, complication rate, number of adverse events, and mid-term clinical outcomes.

A previous in vitro study showed that autologous microfragmented adipose tissue significantly increases the proliferation rate of human tendon stem cells without altering their stemness and differentiation capability. Moreover, treated cells increase the expression of VEGF, which is crucial for the neovascularization of the tissue during the healing process.

Research Design and Method:

At least 5 years after surgery, all enrolled patients in the previous study will be call again and will be asked to complete the ASES, SST, and VAS questionnaire and they will undergo a clinical examination, including the CMS and measurement of isometric strength in shoulder forward flexion, abduction, and external rotation. All strength measures will be performed in triplicate with a dynamometer.

During the same assessment day, the patients would be evaluated with MRI of the operated shoulder in order to assess tendon integrity and calculate rerupture rate according to the classification proposed by Sugaya (types IV and V defined as retears).

NCT06960226,Replication Study: Reducing Pain With Focused Music Listening,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960226,PainMusic2,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical trial is to confirm previous findings that actively tapping along to music can reduce pain more than just listening to music. This study aims to replicate the findings of a previous study (NCT05267795), with one change in how mild pain is created for the experiment. This study involves healthy adults.

The main questions the study aims to answer are:

1. Does actively tapping along to music lower feelings of pain compared to just listening to music?
2. Does actively tapping along to music lower feelings of pain compared to being in silence (with or without tapping)?
3. Is this method of using music and tapping helpful for managing pain?

Researchers will compare the amount of pain participants feel in four different situations:

1. Listening to music while actively tapping their foot along with it.
2. Just listening to music while resting their foot.
3. Actively tapping their foot in silence.
4. Sitting in silence while resting their foot.

Participants in this study will:

Experience brief moments of mild pain on their forearm. This pain is safely created using a small electrical pulse from a device held gently on the skin by the researcher. (This replaces the pressure method used in the original study).

Sometimes listen to music through headphones, and sometimes sit in silence. Sometimes tap their foot along to the music or a beat, and sometimes rest their foot.

This is a medical condition for which one of the current standard treatments is the use of a custom made dental appliance to help hold the person's airway open while asleep so that the person does not suffocate while sleeping. However, while the majority of OSA patients are able to tolerate the use of oral appliance therapy (OAT) for OSA, some patients are incomplete responders to OAT. These patients, despite having improvement, may still have a disease index above the diagnostic threshold for OSA.

Phototherapy (laser therapy) has been used as a method to stiffen the soft palate and parts of the tongue to prevent their collapse. This is a type of cold laser therapy that does not cut/ablate tissue (similar to healing laser therapies). This has been shown to help with both snoring and can also help with OSA, as soft palate and tongue collapse are common areas for where OSA occurs inside the airway.

NCT06960174,Virtual Renality: Assessing the Impact of Virtual Reality on Preoperative Planning in Renal Cancer Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960174,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Rationale:

Preoperative planning for both partial and radical nephrectomies using conventional CT imaging can be challenging due to complex renal anatomy and vascularization. 3D models in virtual reality (VR) may enhance anatomical understanding and improve preoperative planning. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the clinical impact of the use of 3D models in VR in the preoperative planning of partial and radical nephrectomies.

Objective:

The primary objective is to assess the impact of VR on preoperative planning and thereby on the agreement between the preoperative plan and the performed surgery in renal surgery (both partial and radical nephrectomies). The secondary objectives focus on the urologist's understanding of the anatomy and how the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes are influenced by the use of VR in the preoperative planning.

Study design:

The Virtual Renality study is a single-center randomized clinical trial conducted at the St. Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein.

Study population:

The study population will consist of adult patients (18+) with a suspected RCC who are indicated for (partial) nephrectomy at St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein.

Intervention:

For the intervention group, the urologist will review a 3D virtual model of the renal anatomy in addition to the original CT scan during preoperative planning. For the control group, only the CT scan will be used for preoperative planning, according to the current standard of care.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

The primary study endpoint is the surgical concordance score, which describes the concordance between the actual performed surgery and the preoperatively determined surgical plan.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit, and group relatedness:

Participation in this study will not require any additional physical examinations, blood samples, hospital visits, or questionnaires beyond standard clinical care.

NCT06960161,Exploring the Use of Phototherapy to Improve CPAP Compliance,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960161,,RECRUITING,"Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a type of light therapy like lasers and LEDs. PBM was previously known by different terms like ""low-level laser therapy"" (LLLT) or ""photobiostimulation."" LLLT, despite its name, can also have effects beyond biomodulation, including thermal effects useful in medical imaging and therapy.

PBM works by interacting with our biological systems, and its clinical benefits depend on factors like light wavelength, and energy output.

PBM has various clinical applications, such as wound healing, pain management, and treatment in sports injuries. It's also used as an adjunct to surgery, reducing risks and improving outcomes in areas like wound healing and inflammation. In oral medicine, PBM is applied to conditions like oral aphthous ulcers and is well-recognized for its positive effects in treatment of oral inflammation for oncology patients.

Recent studies indicate that PBM, when administered by trained professionals, can improve sleep quality and reduce snoring/SDB in adults. There's potential for its use in treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), showing effectiveness similar to dental sleep appliances but with fewer side effects. This effect seems to be from stabilization of the upper airway. Combining PBM with other therapies, like dental sleep appliances, has shown promise in enhancing effectiveness.

Approximately 20% of patients are diagnosed at a borderline resectable or resectable stage, and surgical resection remains the only curative option. However, total pancreatectomy (TP) often leads to severe diarrhea (incidence rate: 43.5%) due to exocrine insufficiency, and current pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy shows limited efficacy in some patients.

Recent studies highlight the critical role of gut microbiota in pancreatic cancer progression and postoperative recovery. Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibit a 1000-fold increase in intrapancreatic bacterial load compared to normal tissues, with significantly elevated Bacteroides abundance and reduced Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in fecal samples. Postoperative dysbiosis is linked to complications; for example, diarrhea after cholecystectomy is dominated by Proteobacteria, suggesting that microbial imbalance may underlie diarrhea following TP.

To address this, the study proposes fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via oral capsules.

NCT06960070,Clinical Success of Onlays Fabricated With Different Types of Resin,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06960070,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Additive manufacturing, also referred to as ""3D printing"" or ""rapid prototyping,"" is defined as the process of joining materials layer by layer to create an object based on 3D model data. In this method, a digital data set is first created on a computer (computer-aided design, CAD) and then transferred to a 3D printer. The designed object is produced by printing it in successive layers.

In contrast, in subtractive manufacturing, restorations are produced by milling homogeneous blocks based on computer-designed models. Compared to subtractive manufacturing technology, additive manufacturing allows for the production of more complex, detailed, and larger structures with much less material waste and without excessive use of force.

It is thought that additive manufacturing has the potential to overcome the disadvantages of subtractive manufacturing. Over the past decade, global sales of industrial and personal 3D printers, materials, and services have increased by more than 33% annually.

Due to its success in the production of surgical guides, temporary and permanent restorations, crowns and bridges, occlusal splints, frameworks, and orthodontic appliances, this technology has attracted significant interest in the field of dentistry.

Although additive manufacturing has started to be used as an alternative to subtractive manufacturing in many applications, there is still a lack of information regarding the chemical composition, mechanical, and physical properties of printable resins. Moreover, clinical data on the use of these resins in permanent restorations are quite limited.

As the gold standard for difficult airway management, FBTI is essential for anesthesiologists to navigate anatomical complexities effectively.

Training in FBTI requires theoretical understanding, hands-on practice, and experience. Skill acquisition and knowledge must reach an appropriate level before trainees perform on patients. Simulated scenarios offer a controlled environment for practitioners to develop muscle memory and problem-solving skills without risking patient safety. However, commercial simulators for FBTI are often expensive and inaccessible in many countries. Lebanon, a low- and middle-income country, currently faces a multifaceted economic and financial crisis. Hence, securing enough internal funds to support novice learners using available high-cost simulator training is challenging. Various low-cost simulators have been proposed in the literature, aiming to provide affordable training for novice anesthesiologists, particularly in regions where expensive simulators are scarce.

Aim: This study aims to evaluate a low-cost, locally designed simulator by comparing skill acquisition and retention to a commercial airway part-task trainer in FBTI.

Study design: Multicenter simulation-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) Methods: This simulation-based interventional clinical trial will include anesthesia PGY-I and PGY-II residents inexperienced in FBTI techniques from eight medical schools in Lebanon. The study comprises two main phases and one intermediate phase. Phase one is the development phase, whereby a Delphi approach will be utilized to develop a standardized Global Rating Scale for FBTI (LAU-modified SGR). The intermediate phase constitutes piloting the tool developed with LAU postgraduate trainees years 3, 4, and 5 from the pulmonology department, Ear, Nose, and Throat department, along with the anesthesiology residents. Phase two is the main RCT study whereby all participating residents will receive training on a theoretical course covering flexible bronchoscopy equipment, anatomy, indications, and complications, which will also be supplemented by a procedural video. After which residents will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will undergo training on the locally designed low-cost model (RAN), whereas the other group will train on the airway part-task trainer. Participants' FBTI skills will be assessed using the high-fidelity CAS simulator and the LAU-modified SGR for FBTI to evaluate both theoretical and procedural fluency (i.e., retention of FBTI skills). Assessments will be conducted immediately after the training sessions, with follow-ups at three and six months.

Disparities in T2D are driven in part by independent, modifiable risk factors including low levels of physical activity, sleep, and poor diet. Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone for maintaining glucose control and managing T2D. However, few studies have developed and tested lifestyle interventions for Hispanic youth with T2D. Digital health interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behaviors like physical activity, sleep, and diet, have demonstrated effectiveness among adults. Studies that use health-based smartphone applications have demonstrated preliminary efficacy for improving health-related lifestyle behaviors as these digital tools leverage behavior change techniques (e.g. self-monitoring, goal-setting, feedback) that have proven effective. Use of digital technology allows for the continuous delivery of intervention content into the home environment extending the reach of clinical care while engaging youth in a format that is age-appropriate given that today's youth are digital frontrunners.

NCT06959849,"Robot-assisted Surgery for Colorectal Cancer Resection: A Population-based Analysis of Prevalence, Trends and Outcomes",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06959849,RoChiKoKa,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The objective of this research project is to conduct a comparative analysis of short- and long-term outcomes between conventional laparoscopic and robot-assisted resection procedures for colorectal cancer. The analysis will utilize population-based DRG data and clinical cancer registry data from Germany. The rationale behind this project is that the number of conversions to open surgery in robotic procedures is approximately half that observed in laparoscopic procedures. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that conversions are associated with a markedly elevated risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this project is to estimate the number of avoidable adverse outcomes resulting from the use of robot-assisted surgery.

Multiple studies have shown, that the conversion rate for robot-assisted surgery (RAS) is consistently lower than that for conventional laparoscopic (LAP) surgery. Additionally, conversions have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of adverse surgical outcomes. However, most studies have not achieved statistical significance, due to limited sample sizes and insufficient statistical power. A comprehensive review of the existing literature reveals three key findings. First, the conversion rate for RAS procedures is approximately half that of LAP procedures. Second, conversions are associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse short-term outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality, as well as prolonged hospitalization. Third, although not significant due to low case numbers, there is some evidence suggesting improved long-term survival with RAS.

The hypothesis is that the lower conversion rate in RAS for colorectal surgery is associated with fewer adverse outcomes compared to LAP procedures. This study aims to estimate the number of short-term adverse outcomes that could be prevented through avoided conversions when surgeries are performed using RAS rather than LAP. Furthermore, it will estimate the potential life years saved due to improved survival resulting from fewer conversions. To analyze avoidable short-term adverse outcomes, Germany's nationwide diagnosis-related group (DRG) data for the years 2016-2023 will be used. Multiple logistic regression analyses will be conducted, and estimated marginal means will be computed to provide population-based estimates. To estimate potential life years saved, clinical cancer registry data will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Long-term survival curves (three-year overall and disease-free survival) will be computed and compared between RAS and LAP surgeries, with a focus on converted operations.

The quality of surgical outcomes (perioperative and short-term postoperative outcomes) for RAS and LAP colorectal surgery will compared using DRG data. This study will analyze the factors that moderate the difference in conversion rates and their relationship to outcome quality. Inclusion criteria will comprise patients who underwent elective resection for a primary malignant colorectal neoplasm. The study further aims to compare long-term overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between RAS and laparoscopic surgery using clinical cancer registry data.

This project represents the first comprehensive analysis in Germany of the use of robotic assistance systems in colorectal surgery based on routine data. A key objective is to assess the prevalence of robotic assistance systems in clinical practice and to estimate the number of conversions-and corresponding adverse outcomes-that could be avoided through their use.",NO,Colorectal Cancer (CRC)|Robotic Surgical Procedures|Laparoscopic Abdominal Surgery|Outcome Assessment,DEVICE: Use of robot surgical system,"Proportion of procedures performed with robotic assistance systems, Change in the proportion of surgical resection procedures across time, stratified by procedure type and indication at the patient level (Study-Part I), During surgery (intraoperative)|Conversion rate, Rate of conversions to open surgery for laparoscopic procedures and robot-assisted procedures (Study-Part II), During surgery (intraoperative)|Mortality rate, Proportion of patients that died after surgical intervention (Study-Part II), 30 days|3-year overall survival rates, Death from any cause within three years after the operation (Study-Part III), 3 years after index operation","Patient characteristics, Age, Sex, Indication for surgery, Comorbidities (Study-Part I), At the beginning of the index operation|Length-of-stay, Duration of the postoperative inpatient stay (Study-Part II), From the day of the index operation to hospital discharge (up to 90 days post-operation, on average)|Postoperative complications, Presence of Anastomotic insufficiency, Surgical site infection, Urinary tract infection, Acquired pneumonia, Thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, Renal insufficiency, Myocardial infarction, Haemorrhage, Shock, Vomiting (Study-Part II), 30 days postoperatively|Revision surgery, (Study part II), 30 days postoperatively|Stay in intensive care unit, Stay in intensive care unit after index operation for complications (Study-Part II), 30 days postoperatively|Disease-Free 3-year survival, For all patients that had a R0 residual status after resection: the length of time without any signs or symptoms of cancer (Study-Part III), 3 years after index operation","Number of hospitals using robot-assistance systems, Change in the number of hospitals that perform surgical resection procedures with robot-assistance systems across time, stratified by procedure type and indication (Study-Part I), During surgery (intraoperative)|Characteristics of hospitals which use robot-assistance systems, Intervention volume, geographical distribution (Study-Part I), During surgery (intraoperative)",Medizinische Hochschule Brandenburg Theodor Fontane,Intuitive Foundation,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,128000,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,RoChiKoKa,2016-01-01,2023-12-31,2025-05-01,2025-05-07,,2025-05-07,,

Another approach is gene therapy; this treatment repairs the mutation in a person's own stem cells by base editing. Researchers want to know if these base-edited stem cells can help people with CD40L-HIGM syndrome.

Objective:

To test base-edited stem cell transplant in 1 person with CD40L-HIGM syndrome.

Eligibility:

A male with CD40L-HIGM syndrome.

Design:

Participant will be screened. Tests will include medically indicated imaging scans, blood tests, and a sample of tissue and fluid (biopsy) may be taken from the bone marrow.

Participant may undergo apheresis to collect stem cells. The collected stem cells will undergo base editing to repair the mutation.

For treatment, participant will be admitted to the hospital for 5 weeks or more. For 2 weeks he will receive drugs to prepare his body for receiving the stem cells. After receiving the edited stem cells, he will remain in the hospital until his cell counts recover.

Participant will have follow-up visits every few months in the first 2 years after treatment. The bone marrow biopsy will be repeated after 2 years.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does taking BioKid LR reduce the chance of constipation coming back after stopping PEG? Can BioKid LR help children maintain regular bowel movements without needing to restart laxatives? Researchers will compare children who take BioKid LR with those who take a placebo (an inactive powder) to see if the probiotic helps prevent constipation from returning.

Participants will:

Take PEG 3350 (a common laxative) for 12 weeks along with either BioKid LR or a placebo.

After 12 weeks, begin gradually stopping PEG while continuing with BioKid LR or placebo for another 12 weeks.

Then continue only with BioKid LR or placebo for an additional 28 weeks (total study duration: 52 weeks).

Keep a stool diary to track bowel habits and any side effects. Attend 5 study visits for physical exams and monitoring (weeks 0, 12, 24, 38, 52).

The study includes 80 children and is double-blinded, meaning neither the doctors nor the participants know who is receiving the real probiotic or the placebo.

The primary outcome is how long it takes for constipation to return after stopping PEG, requiring retreatment.

Secondary outcomes include:

How many children still need long-term treatment. How many have regular bowel movements without accidents (in children over 4 years old).

The MRS consists of multiple domains and specific items. Typically, it includes categories such as somatic symptoms (like hot flashes, sweating, sleep disturbances), psychological symptoms (including mood swings, anxiety, and depression), and urogenital symptoms (such as vaginal dryness and urinary problems). Each item within these domains is scored on a numerical scale, usually ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4, depending on the severity of the symptom, and the maximum total score would be 44. A score of 0 often indicates the absence of the symptom, while higher scores reflect increasing levels of discomfort or impairment., From randomization to the end of treatment at 8 weeks","Change of Menopause Quality of Life (MENQOL) Questionnaire, The Menopause Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) assesses the impact of menopausal symptoms across four domains: vasomotor, sexual, physical, and psychosocial (Maturitas 24:161-175, 1996). Symptoms like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and depression are evaluated. Participants first indicate if they've had symptoms in the past month, then rate bothersomeness on a 7-point scale. Ratings are recorded from 2 (symptom present but not bothersome) to 8 (extremely bothered). Domain scores are calculated as the mean of item scores; higher scores mean more troublesome symptoms and poorer quality of life.

This 14-item questionnaire requires respondents to rate their joint pain experienced over the past week and the extent to which the pain disrupts their activities. Ratings are given on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 indicates ""no pain"" and 10 represents ""pain as severe as imaginable"". The range of the score number is from 0 to 140 points., From randomization to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Change of Hot flash Score, The Hot Flash Score was measured using a prospective, self-report hot flash diary, which women were instructed to fill out in real-time (J Clin Oncol 19:4280-4290, 2001). The determination of hot flash scores involved allocating points to each hot flash according to the reported severity. Specifically, a hot flash was assigned 1 point for mild severity, 2 points for moderate severity, 3 points for severe severity, and 4 points for very severe severity. For each patient, the points assigned to hot flashes on each day were summed up, and then these daily totals were averaged over each week of the trial period.

The ISI consists of 7 items, and each item is scored on a scale of 0-4. So the total score of the ISI ranges from 0 to 28.

A score of 0-7 indicates no clinically significant insomnia. A score of 8-14 suggests sub - threshold insomnia. A score of 15-21 represents moderate insomnia. A score of 22-28 indicates severe insomnia., From randomization to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Change of Self-Rating Depression Scale（SDS）, The Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) is a self-administered psychological assessment tool used to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals (Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1973;29(3):328-337). The scale contains 20 statements related to common symptoms of depression, such as mood, sleep, appetite, and self-esteem. Respondents rate each statement according to how often they have experienced the described symptom in the past week, using a 4-point scale: 1 (rarely), 2 (sometimes), 3 (mostly), and 4 (almost always).The total raw score of the SDS ranges from 20 (the lowest possible score, indicating no depressive symptoms) to 80 (the highest possible score, suggesting severe depressive symptoms)., From randomization to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Change of Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 - item scale (GAD-7) is a brief self-report questionnaire designed to screen for generalized anxiety disorder and assess the severity of anxiety symptoms (Archives of Internal Medicine, 166(10), 1092-1097). It consists of 7 items related to common symptoms of anxiety, such as feeling nervous, worried, or on edge; not being able to stop or control worrying; and having trouble relaxing.

Each item is scored on a 4 - point scale: 0 (Not at all), 1 (Several days), 2 (More than half the days), and 3 (Nearly every day). The total score of the GAD-7 ranges from 0 to 21.

NCT06959719,ARMSTRONG - Air entRainMent vS sTandard tReatment in nOn-expandable luNG,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06959719,ARMSTRONG,RECRUITING,"This is a randomised controlled trial evaluating whether controlled air introduction into pleural space (air entrainment) during pleural effusion drainage reduces pain, improves patient satisfaction, and facilitates more effective drainage in patients with non-expandable lung (NEL).

NEL lung is a common complication in patients with malignant or chronic pleural effusions, where the lung fails to fully re-expand after fluid removal due to pleural disease or fibrosis. In these patients, drainage often creates excessive negative pressure within the pleural cavity, leading to pain, vasovagal episodes, early termination of drainage, and the need for repeated procedures.

This study investigates a simple, safe, and low-cost intervention using a standard 3-way tap attached to the drainage system. By intermittently opening the tap to atmospheric air during drainage, air enters the pleural cavity in a controlled fashion, reducing negative pressure and potentially reducing pain, improving drainage tolerance, and minimising the need for repeated procedures.

Pleural effusion drainage is a common procedure in patients with advanced malignancy or chronic pleural disease. In patients with NEL, fluid removal creates a vacuum effect within the pleural space due to the inability of the lung to fully re-expand. This negative pressure is a key driver of severe procedural pain, vasovagal symptoms, and premature cessation of drainage. It may also necessitate multiple drainage procedures over a short period.

Currently, there are limited strategies to mitigate this problem, often relying on stopping the procedure prematurely or on analgesia, which does not address the underlying cause.

This trial evaluates the introduction of atmospheric air into the pleural space during drainage as a pragmatic, low-cost solution. The technique uses standard equipment - a 3-way tap - allowing air to be introduced safely and intermittently during drainage to reduce the vacuum effect.

Patients undergoing therapeutic pleural drainage with an indwelling catheter or chest drain will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to:

Standard drainage care (control group)

Drainage with intermittent controlled air introduction (intervention group)

Air entrainment will be performed by briefly opening the 3-way tap to atmospheric air during drainage up to five times, based on patient discomfort and operator discretion. This aims to equalise pleural pressures, reduce pain, and improve drainage outcomes.

Randomisation is weighted 2:1 towards the intervention group to maximise the number of patients who may benefit, following favourable preliminary data. Both patients and outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation.

Outcomes collected

Primary Outcomes:

This test is particularly relevant for assessing fine motor skills and the ability to perform tasks that require both coordination and dexterity.

The tasks include:

Writing a Sentence: Assesses the ability to hold a pen and write legibly. Turning Over Cards: Tests finger dexterity by flipping a set of cards one at a time.

Picking Up Small Objects: Evaluates the ability to manipulate small items, often using a pre-defined set of objects.

Lifting a Paper Clip: Assesses fine motor skills by picking up a small, light object., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Joint Position Sense, Joint position sense is assessed using active reproduction and position differentiation tests. In reproduction, the participant memorises a target position (90º shoulder abduction) and then attempts to replicate it without visual input. In differentiation, they aim to reach half the target angle (45º). An electronic inclinometer (±1º accuracy) fixed to the upper arm measures angles. Markers are placed on anatomical landmarks, and a goniometer is secured parallel to the humeral axis. Tests are performed seated. The target position is passively assumed under supervision and memorised (×3). The participant then reproduces or differentiates the angle (×2 each), confirming with ""stop."" Readings are taken after each attempt. Both sides are tested. The absolute positioning error (absolute difference between target and assumed angles) is used for analysis, based on the mean of two measurements., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Sense of Resistance, Resistance sense is assessed using force reproduction and differentiation tests. In the first, the participant replicates a memorised reference force; in the second, they generate half that force. An electronic dynamometer (±0.1 kG accuracy) is attached to a 12 cm sleeve on the upper arm and connected to the floor via an elastic cord. Tests are conducted in 90º shoulder flexion or abduction. The reference force is defined as the effort needed to stretch the elastic cord slightly for 5 seconds. After adjustments, this is repeated three times, and the participant memorises the force. Then, with eyes closed, they reproduce or halve the force, confirming with ""stop."" The examiner records the values. Each test is repeated three times. Two extremities are tested. The absolute force generation error (normalised difference in %) is used for analysis, based on the mean of three measurements., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Sense of Pressure, Pressure sense is assessed at 5 fixed points on the chest, upper limb, and scapular region, corresponding to different peripheral nerve branches. The test is performed in supine or prone position, depending on the site, with the upper limb abducted to 90º. An algometer is used to apply focused pressure and record force. It has a blunt tip with a 20 mm² contact area and measures with ±0.1 kG accuracy. During testing (eyes closed), the participant says ""stop"" when pressure at a point becomes uncomfortable but not painful. The examiner records the force at that moment. Each point is tested twice. Pressure is applied perpendicularly to the skin, and both sides are assessed. The maximum applied force does not exceed 6 kG to avoid subcutaneous bruising. The final result is the average of the two measurements., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Discriminative Sense, Discriminative sense is tested at 5 fixed points on the chest, upper limb, and scapular area - same as in the pressure sense test. A calliper with two rounded tips is used, with a measurement accuracy of 0.5 mm. With the participant's eyes closed, the examiner applies both tips to the skin and gradually reduces the distance between them. The participant reports whether they feel one or two touch points. When they begin to perceive only one while two are still applied, the distance is recorded. This is repeated twice. The calliper arms are held perpendicular to the skin without added pressure - only the instrument's own weight acts on the surface. One arm always remains at a fixed point, while the other approaches from the side or from distal direction, depending on the location. Both sides of the body are tested. The final result is the average of the two measurements., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Sense of Temperature, Temperature sense is assessed at 5 fixed points on the chest, upper limb, and scapular area, as in the pressure test. A custom-built device with a 3 cm² flat thermal head, heat converter, and digital thermometer is used, offering ±0.5ºC accuracy and precise heat control. With eyes closed, the participant detects a change in temperature. The test begins with the head at neutral temperature (30ºC), increasing steadily at 1ºC every 10 seconds.

The main question it aims to answer is whether participants who use Walkasins on an everyday basis over a six-month period will report better awareness of their foot placement on the ground.

Researchers will compare Walkasins users to a control group of participants who are not using Walkasins to see if the device improves the users' performance on some standing and walking tests. Control group participants will get Walkasins after six months of being in the study.

During the study participants will be asked to do the following:

* Answer questions about their medical history and balance.
* Do some standing and walking tests. Some of the tests will be timed.
* Attend study visits and participate in study phone calls.
* Keep track of any falls and notify study staff if they fall.

Scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 30. Higher scores indicate better postural stability., Baseline, Week 10, Week 26, Week 36 (Control Group), and Week 52|Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), The PSFS asks patients to define up to five specific tasks that they have difficulty with or are unable to perform because of their physical injury or disability. Some research studies adapt the PSFS by asking participants to list three tasks rather than five, which is the plan for this study. The patients then rate their difficulty in performing those tasks on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 meaning ""unable to perform activity"" to 10 meaning ""able to perform activity at the same level as before injury or problem."" The ratings for the three activities are averaged. Higher scores indicate greater ability to perform the activity., Baseline, Week 5, Week 10, Week 18, Week 26, Week 31, Week 36, Week 41, Week 46, and Week 52|PROMIS® PROWalk, Eight items that have the most relevance for measuring change in individuals who have received Walkasins were selected from the 165 items comprising the PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Physical Function. Specifically, the selected items measure an individual's ability to perform various activities that involve upright mobility (balance, standing, and walking). Participants rate the eight items on a scale of 1 to 5; the raw scores are converted to T-scores for comparison to national norms., Baseline, Week 5, Week 10, Week 18, Week 26, Week 31, Week 36, Week 41, Week 46, and Week 52","10-Meter Walk Test, Gait speed will be measured through the 10-Meter Walk Test, timing only the middle 6 meters to allow for acceleration and deceleration. Participants will be instructed to walk at normal speed. Higher numbers indicate faster speeds (i.e., more meters per second)., Baseline, Week 10, Week 26, Week 36 (Control Group), and Week 52|Four-Stage Balance Test, The 4-Stage Balance Test is part of the Centers for Disease Control's recommended test protocol for balance function. It includes four gradually more challenging postures the subject is exposed to: (1) Stand with feet side by side. (2) Stand with feet in semi-tandem stance. (3) Stand with feet in tandem stance. (4) Stand on one leg. Participants pass each level if they can hold the stance for 10 seconds and then move on to the next stance. If they cannot hold the stance, the test ends. Higher times indicate better balance than lower times., Baseline, Week 10, Week 26, Week 36 (Control Group), and Week 52|Modified Multidirectional Reach Test, The Multidirectional Reach Test is a quick screening tool for fall risk to indirectly measure the limits of stability. The participant outstretches his/her arm to shoulder height next to a yardstick mounted on the wall; then he/she reaches as far as possible in the instructed direction without taking a step. The test administrator records the start and end position of the index finger of the outstretched hand, and the difference represents the total reach for that direction. Higher differences indicate better stability.

The Modified Multidirectional Reach Test used in this clinical trial will include only forward and backwards reaching that is completed and recorded with eyes closed. It will omit the left and right reaches., Baseline, Week 10, Week 26, Week 36 (Control Group), Week 52|Single Leg Stance Test, The Single Leg Stance Test (also called the unipedal stance test) ""is a simple test for measuring static aspects of balance."" It ""is related to conditions such as peripheral neuropathy and intermittent claudication"" and ""is also associated with an increased risk for falls"" (Spring et al., 2007) Participants stand unassisted on one leg with their hands on their hips.

From a seated position in a standard armchair, the participant is asked to stand up from the chair, walk to a line on the floor 10 feet away at normal pace, turn, walk back to the chair at normal pace, and sit down again. The tester records the time taken from the command ""Go"" until the subject sits down again. Lower times indicate better/faster performance.

The TUG-Cog is performed as described above; in addition, the participant is asked to count backwards by threes from a randomly selected number between 20 and 100. Lower times indicate better/faster performance., Baseline, Week 10, Week 26, Week 36 (Control Group), Week 52|Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale 6 (ABC-6), Powell and Myers developed the 16-item Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale to detect levels of balance confidence in older adults. Schepens et al. (2009) validated a 6-item version of the ABC, using the six most challenging activities from the 16-item scale. The six tasks are rated on a scale of 0 to 100; a score of 0 indicates no confidence and a score of 100 indicates complete confidence when performing the task. The overall score is calculated by adding the individual items then dividing by the total number of items (6). The higher the score, the greater the person's balance confidence; thus, higher scores indicate that subjects are more confident of their balance., Baseline, Week 5, Week 10, Week 18, Week 26, Week 31, Week 36, Week 41, Week 46, and Week 52|EuroQol HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L consists of five questions, one each on ""mobility,"" ""self-care,"" ""usual activities,"" ""pain / discomfort,"" and ""anxiety / depression.""

The three questions are not disease specific. Two items address pain experienced in the past seven days; the other, pain at present. In addition, we will ask participants to rate the neuropathic pain in their feet on scale of 0-10 (0 = No Pain, 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable)., Baseline, Week 10, Week 26, Week 36, Week 52|Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) and Telephone Assessment of Physical Activity (TAPA), The Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) is a measure of physical activity, designed for use with older adults. The researchers will administer the RAPA during in-person visits and the TAPA, a telephone-based assessment of physical activity based on the RAPA, during the Weeks 18 and 36 telephone visits. The assessments consist of seven questions on light, moderate, and vigorous physical (aerobic) activities to which the participants respond ""yes"" or ""no,"" depending on whether or not the question is true of them. Scoring is based on the number of the item to which the participants report the highest positive response (e.g., if the participant answered ""Yes"" to question 4 and ""No"" to 5, 6, and 7, then ""4"" is the participant's score). Higher scores indicate more physical activity. The final two items address strength and flexibility and are scored separately., Baseline, Week 10, Week 18, Week 26, Week 36, and Week 52|Walkasins Experience Survey, At the follow-up visits, the study team will ask the participants assigned to the Walkasins user group specific questions about their experience with Walkasins.

To conduct the test, a clinician applies pressure with various sizes of monofilament to selected parts of the foot and asks the participant to indicate when he/she feels the filament. Including catch trials helps to ensure accurate test results. Per CMS, inability to feel a 10-gram monofilament on at least two of five test sites on either foot indicates loss of protective sensation (LOPS)., Baseline, Week 26, and Week 52|Vibration Test, Vibration is one of several types of sensation encompassed within the somatosensory system, and it is often diminished in individuals with neuropathy. To examine vibration sense, a clinician applies a low-frequency (128 Hz) tuning fork to bony prominences and asks the participant (with closed eyes) to report when the vibration starts and stops.

In our geography where earthquakes are frequently experienced, two earthquakes occurred on February 6, 2023 in the Southeastern part of our country, the first with a magnitude of 7.7 and the second with a magnitude of 7.5. The earthquakes that occurred with Pazarcık/Kahramanmaraş as the epicenter are one of the major earthquakes in our country. It is known that a significant portion of individuals exposed to such large earthquakes are affected mentally and physically. However, although psychological effects have been known for many years, the physical changes that occur due to psychological effects are still being investigated today. Many studies on the subject focus on complaints of dizziness and disturbances in balance following an earthquake. However, it is also possible that different physical effects may develop. The aim of our current project proposal is to examine the effects of basic body awareness therapy on core muscle endurance, posture, balance, quality of life and body awareness in earthquake survivors. Within the scope of our project, 30 earthquake survivors between the ages of 18-45 who experienced the February 6, 2023 earthquake will be included in the study. For all individuals, evaluation of core muscles will be performed with McGill Endurance test, Prone Bridge test and Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback, posture evaluation with New York Posture Assessment Method (NYPAM) and lateral digital imaging in standing posture, balance evaluation with Balance on One Leg test (eyes open and closed), Functional Forward Reach Test and Y Balance Test, quality of life evaluation with Short Form-36 (SF-36) and body awareness evaluation with Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ). Individuals will be divided into 2 groups by closed envelope randomization method. The first group was determined as the intervention group and the second group as the control group. While Basic Body Awareness Therapy will be applied to the individuals in the intervention group, no application will be made to the individuals in the control group. All assessments will be applied to individuals in both the intervention group and the control group 2 times in total at the beginning of the study and at the end of 8 weeks. Our project, which is foreseen to be completed in 12 months, is planned to be carried out in 16 sessions, 2 days a week, 1 hour a day, for 8 weeks, and to give home exercise 2 days a week, 1 hour a day. The fact that the evaluations to be applied within the scope of the project proposal and the exercise approach to be used have not been applied on earthquake victims before gives our study originality. It has the potential to form the basis for future studies in the field of health related to earthquake victims.",NO,Earthquake|Core|Posture|Balance|Quality of Life|Body Awareness,OTHER: Temel beden farkındalığı terapisi,"Trunk flexor test, The trunk flexor test is performed with the trunk at 60° flexion and the knees and hips at 90° flexion.

The test is terminated when the position is disrupted. The measurement results are recorded in seconds., From registration to the start of treatment.|Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit Usage, Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit measures the contraction force of the deep trunk muscles transversus abdominis. Chattanooga Stabilizer will be used in the measurement to be taken in this study. The inflatable device is placed centrally under the abdomen with its lower edge at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine. Before the test, individuals are taught how to selectively contract the transversus abdominis muscle with the corset method. After the pressure of the manometer is set to 70 mmHg, individuals are asked to reduce the pressure by slowly contracting the transversus abdominis muscle with the abdominal corset technique without holding their breath and to maintain this contraction for 5 seconds. The test is terminated if the pressure increases exceed 70 mmHg during the measurement. The average pressure change at the end of three contractions is calculated., From registration to the start of treatment.|Posture assessment, The postures of the individuals participating in the study will be assessed using the ""New York Posture Assessment Method (NYPDY)"". The individual is asked to stand in a resting position and points are given by observational assessment according to the posture patterns shown in the table. In this assessment system, changes in posture that may occur in 13 different parts of the body are scored by monitoring them. Accordingly, if the individual's posture is correct, five (5) points are given, if it is moderately impaired, three (3) points are given, and if it is severely impaired, one (1) points are given. The maximum total score obtained as a result of the test is 65 and the minimum is 13. The standard assessment criteria developed for this test are determined as ""very good"" if the total score is ≥ 45, ""good"" if it is 40-44, ""moderate"" if it is 30-39, ""poor"" if it is 20-29, and ""poor"" if it is ≤ 19. It is stated in the literature that the use of real-time (simultaneous) scoring limits, From registration to the start of treatment.|Single-Legged Balance Test, This is a test in which the time the individual stands on the right and left lower extremities in balance is measured in seconds and evaluates static balance. The balance test on one leg is performed by recording the time from the moment the individual starts standing on one leg until the first moment when postural stability is disrupted. Measurements are performed in two stages: eyes open and closed. For the test performed with eyes open, the individual is asked to lift one leg without touching the supporting leg, look straight ahead and maintain their balance. For the test performed with eyes closed, the individual is asked to close their eyes, lift one leg without touching the supporting leg and maintain their balance. 360 seconds is accepted as the upper limit for the completion of the test., From registration to the start of treatment.|Functional Forward Reach Test, The maximum distance that an individual can reach forward and sideways while standing upright is measured in centimeters. In order to measure the distance reached, a tape measure is placed on the wall at the height of the individual\&#39;s shoulder. The individual stands with their arm flexed at 90 degrees and their fist closed, without touching the wall but close to it. The assessor marks the head of the individual\&#39;s 3rd metacarpal on the wall and asks the individual to reach forward as far as they can without taking a step. The assessor marks the head of the individual\&#39;s 3rd metacarpal on the wall again and measures the difference between the beginning and the end with the tape measure. 15 cm and below indicates a significantly increased risk of falling, and 15 to 25 cm indicates a moderate risk of falling. The validity and reliability of the test were performed by Weiner et al., From registration to the start of treatment.|Y Balance Test, A simple but reliable test used to measure dynamic balance. It is a dynamic test performed in a single-legged stance that requires strength, flexibility, core control and proprioception.

All measurements are performed for both extremities while the individual is barefoot, barefoot and with their hands on their waists. While one extremity of the individual remains fixed on the ground, the other extremity is asked to go to the maximum distance it can extend in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral directions and return to the starting point in a balanced manner. After six trials in each direction for both legs, the tests will be performed in 3 repetitions. The average of the tests will be taken for each direction and the ratio to the leg length will be recorded in centimeters., From registration to the start of treatment.|Assessment of Quality of Life, One of the most frequently used questionnaires in the literature for assessing quality of life is the SF-36. It has a generic criterion feature among quality of life scales and provides wide-ranging measurement. It was developed and put into use by the Rand Corporation in 1992. It consists of a total of 36 items and provides measurement of a total of 8 dimensions: physical function, physical role difficulty, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role difficulty and mental health. Scoring is done between 0-100. The value of ""100"" indicates good health status, and the value of ""0"" indicates poor health status. Its validity and reliability in Turkish was done in 1999., From registration to the start of treatment.|Body Awareness Assessment, Body Awareness Questionnaire will be used. The original name of the questionnaire is Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ). It was developed by Stephanie A. Shields and her colleagues in 1989. It is a scale that includes items related to the individual\&#39;s physiological, psychological, emotional and social awareness levels, as well as sleep disorders, differences between being sick and not being sick, and physical and mental reactions and estimation levels specific to specific situations related to body awareness. Turkish validity and reliability were conducted in 2017. It consists of 18 items and 4 subgroups.

NCT06959212,Investigation of Mnesic Capacities in Patients With a Disorder of Consciousness,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06959212,MemoDoC,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Following severe brain damage, some individuals lose partial or total awareness of themselves and their environment, falling into a coma that can evolve towards a Disorder of Consciousness (DoC). Accurately diagnosing the depth of consciousness alteration, and thus characterizing the patient's residual state of consciousness, is a real medical challenge, yet crucial for establishing a neurological prognosis, predicting cognitive outcome, and guiding medical decisions. Clinicians attempt to classify DoC patients into different global states (e.g. coma, Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS), Minimally Conscious State (MCS)) depending on their residual level of arousal and awareness.

In recent years, the improvement of diagnostic tools and the use of a multimodal approach combining clinical, neurophysiological and neuroimaging examinations, have greatly refined this assessment and revealed the existence of possible discrepancies between clinical observation (e.g. poor consciousness state like UWS) and brain activity (richer, MCS+ type, or even conscious) so-called Cognitive-Motor Dissociation, making it essential to search for any 'hidden cognition' not revealed by the clinical behavioral examination. It is therefore essential to have tools that can not only probe consciousness level, but also provide a detailed profile of patients' residual cognitive abilities - such as language, attention or memory - which are essential dimmensions of conscious experience and shape waking cognitive life. This could crucially improve the neurological diagnostic and prognostic' accuracy of these disorders, as well as allowing to infer the eventual subjective experience of these patients. Indeed, we still know very little about the possible conscious 'contents' involved in these states. What does the possible 'mental life' of DoC patients look like? A multidimensional exploration of their cognition is needed, requiring the development of innovative methods capable of probing cognitive functions in the absence of any communication with the patient.

Thus, the general aim of this study lies in the development of tools for the cognitive exploration of DoC patients and their application at patients' bedside in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We're particularly interested in assessing memory capacities in these patients, as exploration of memory has immediate clinical implications, since memory encoding during DoC could impact patients' quality of life and be implicated in the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in case of consciousness recovery. More specifically, we want to tackle the following questions: Are patients suffering from a DoC able to form, consolidate and retrieve new memories (anterograde memory)? Are they able to recall memories from their 'past life' (retrograde memory)? Previous research suggests that some DoC patients retain the ability to reactivate old autobiographical memory traces, and to present automatic short-term sensory memory processes, or residual working memory. Nevertheless, DoC patients' memory abilities have been little studied to date, despite their clinical relevance.

We postulate that memory could be differentially preserved between different clinical states of DoC such as UWS and MCS. At the group level, we expect MCS patients to have better learning and memory retrieval abilities than UWS patients. We therefore expect memory functions to be affected by brain lesions and, consequently, by consciousness alteration, although we envisage the preservation of unconscious memory processes (e.g. in non-declarative memory subtypes such as perceptual memory) in UWS patients. We hypothesize that the presence of robust markers of memory processes will vary, at the single-patient level, according to the types and stages of memory tested, informing the cognitive profile of the patient suffering from a DoC.

By providing information on the potential presence of memory capacities that cannot be revealed by clinical examination, the physiological tools we are developing in this study will open a crucial window onto non-communicating patients' cognition. Defining DoC patients' memory profile could not only improve their care during and after the disorder (reflection on the quality of life in ICU; better understanding of cognitive and psychological symptoms occurring after a DoC (e.g. amnesia, PTSD); orientation of rehabilitation strategies), but also improve the diagnostic accuracy of these troubles if memory proves to be differentially preserved between different DoC states such as UWS and MCS. Ultimately, we aim to refine the neurological prognosis of these non-responsive patients, by predicting their cognitive outcome thanks to these innovative physiological tools. On a more fundamental level, this project questions the interplay of memory and consciousness, exploring which forms of memory do and do not require a conscious state.",NO,Disorders of Consciousness,"OTHER: Physiological recordings, Semi-structured interviews, Psychological scales","EEG-Electrodermal activity, Composite primary outcome measure: Presence of at least one of the following three predifined markers of memory processes:

NCT06959147,High-Voltage Long-Duration Pulsed Radiofrequency Combined With Liposomal Bupivacaine Subcutaneous Block for Herpes Zoster-Associated Neuralgia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06959147,,RECRUITING,"Research Objectives Background and Significance: Zoster-associated neuralgia (ZAN) refers to neuropathic pain experienced by herpes zoster (HZ) patients before, during, and after rash resolution, characterized by paroxysmal, lightning-like, or knife-like sensations. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common type of chronic pain, is often accompanied by physical-psychological impairments, social dysfunction, and anxiety-depression. While high-voltage long-term pulsed radiofrequency (HL-PRF) has become a conventional treatment for ZAN, it is limited by residual postoperative localized pain and suboptimal efficacy for refractory cases. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB), a sustained-release analgesic providing up to 72 hours of pain relief, offers potential for combined subcutaneous injection to enhance symptomatic control.

Study Process:

This clinical study focuses on evaluating the efficacy of HL-PRF combined with LB subcutaneous injection in treating ZAN. The trial will be conducted from December 16, 2024, to December 14, 2026, with an anticipated enrollment of 92 participants. Patients will be randomized into two groups:

HL-PRF group: Under CT-guided localization, high-voltage pulsed radiofrequency (HL-PRF) therapy was precisely delivered to the pathologically compromised dorsal root ganglion (DRG).

HL-PRF+LB group: HL-PRF treatment followed by LB subcutaneous injection at the painful lesion site 2 hours post-procedure.

Clinical data will be collected preoperatively, and inflammatory factors will be assessed on the first postoperative day. Follow-up evaluations via telephone will occur at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. By analyzing changes in observed indicators before and after treatment, this study aims to determine the clinical efficacy of combining HL-PRF with LB subcutaneous injection for ZAN.",NO,"Herpes Zoster Pain|Neuralgia, Postherpetic",DRUG: High-Voltage Long-Duration Pulsed Radiofrequency plus Liposomal Bupivacaine group|OTHER: High-Voltage Long-Duration Pulsed Radiofrequency,"NRS, 0 indicates no pain,1-3 indicate mild pain,4-6 indicate moderate pain, 7-10indicate severe pain., Baseline and on days 1, 3, 7, 30, 90 ,180 post-interventions","The Zoster Brief Pain Inventory, The instrument comprises two validated domains: pain intensity quantification and pain-related functional interference assessment.

NCT06959134,Community Health Workers-led Multicomponent Intervention for Hypertension Control in Rwanda,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06959134,,COMPLETED,"This study will involve patients, families and healthcare providers in the following ways

1. Patients; The main study participants will be patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are currently managed at the health center level. After being enrolled in the study the patients will be asked to follow the recommendations given by healthcare providers and community health workers during the study period(Intervention group follow up of one year), and will be required to continuously respect the standard appointment at the health center and in addition to this they will be visited by community health workers at their household at least once per month, and during this visit they will have a health education basically on medication adherence and lifestyle modifications including adopting a culture of healthy physical activity for better control of hypertension not only this but community health worker will take one measurement on Blood pressure in between the month in addition to the usual measurement taken at the health center at the time of the regular appointment. And then on this side everytime the community health worker will visit a patient , family member will be requested to be present for helping to remind the patient the healthy habit discussed as most of these patients are old requiring a close follow up.
2. Family; Will play a key role in helping the patient to adopt new healthy habit depending on the preference and reminding the patient on adhering to medications regimen but also notify the community health worker or the research if there is any adverse health outcome occured during the research period.
3. Health care provider; This will involves healthcare providers on different level mainly the Community health workers and Nurses working in Non Communicable disease Clinic at the health centers.

Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be randomly assigned to four health centers in the intervention arm and another four health centers for routine health care hypertensive care, enrolling 25 patients with uncontrolled hypertension per health center, equivalent to 200 total sample size.

Participants: Patients with uncontrolled hypertension followed-up from health centers non-communicable disease (NCD) clinics in eight health centers(Gihogwe, Kagugu, Remera and Bumbogo in Gasabo and Nyamata, Mayange, Gashora and Ntarama health center in Bugesera district.

Interventions: Participants in the intervention arm will receive an integrated community health worker led- multicomponent intervention (CHW led-MCI) which includes CHW-led home-based intervention including health coaching, monthly home blood pressure monitoring and feedback, lifestyle changes and medication adherence. While those in the control arm received routine health center nurse led management of hypertension in Non-communicable diseases (NCD) clinics ('standard of care').

Outcomes: Effectiveness of the CHW led-MCI will be evaluated through three main research objectives and their outcomes. To evaluate if Integrated CHW led-MCI can control hypertension will be measured through primary outcome clinical outcomes are (i) the difference in the proportion of patients with controlled hypertension (\< 130/80 mmHg) between the CHW led-MCI intervention and control groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and secondary on lowing blood pressure, mean blood pressure will be reported, dietary sodium consumption, glucose, BMI as well as improving medication adherence between the CHW led-MCI intervention and control groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (Objective 1). We will explore the facilitators and barriers in the implementation of CHW-led MCI to control hypertension at Rwandan health centers from the patient, health center nurses, facility managers, and policymakers perspectives (objective 2). Finally, we will evaluate the cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of CHW-led MCI implementation outcomes to inform policymakers on a scale out of the intervention (objective 3).

The outcome will be measured using an interview guide to conduct interview and FGD. Interview guides (IDIs and FGDs will be developed in accordance with previous literature reviews and research on CHW-led MCI).The PI will collect the data, assisted by a trained research assistant. All interviews will held in a nearby, quiet, and convenient room for the study participants. All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim in Kinyarwanda (the local language) to English. However, the work will be re-evaluated again by the PI and double-checked by the research supervisors. The transcripts will be loaded into the NVivo 11 software for coding and data analysis.We will use these coding to find connections between themes and identify overarching principles., Data will be collected from the 3 to 6 months of data collection","Cost, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of community health workers led multi components intervention, QALYs will be the primary measurement of efficacy outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the multicomponent intervention and normal care will be computed by dividing the cost difference by the difference in efficacy in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). One-way sensitivity analysis will be used to address methodological and individual parameter uncertainties. A tornado diagram analysis will be conducted to determine the relative weight of each variable in terms of total uncertainty. Parameters for sensitivity analyses will be chosen based on systematic fluctuations around the basic model's parameters or disparities between trial data and published studies. The parameters investigated by one-way sensitivity analysis will include time horizon, discount rate for costs and QALYs, transition probabilities, relative risk of HTN events, and HTN.

NCT06958965,Resistance Exercise Training on Vascular and Physical Function in Postmenopausal Women,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958965,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Postmenopausal women often face risks of vascular dysfunction and muscle deterioration due to estrogen deficiency. These changes significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Previous studies have shown a significant positive correlation between vascular endothelial function and muscle strength. Moreover, muscle strength is a stronger predictor of mortality than muscle mass and is closely associated with the maintenance of functional independence in daily life. However, studies investigating the effects of whole-body progressive resistance training on vascular function and physical performance in postmenopausal women remain limited. This study aims to examine changes in vascular function and muscle strength in postmenopausal women following a whole-body progressive resistance training program.",NO,Postmenopausal Women,OTHER: Resistance exercise training,"Flow-mediated dilation-endothelial function, During the test, participants were instructed to remain in a supine position with the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees and the palm facing upward. A friction-reducing sleeve and a sphygmomanometer cuff were placed on the distal part of the non-dominant forearm. The cuff inflation pressure was set at least 50 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure measured from the dominant arm and maintained for 5 minutes. Immediately after the 5-minute occlusion period, the cuff was rapidly deflated, and the brachial artery diameter was continuously monitored for up to 3 minutes to capture post-deflation vascular changes., Change from baseline at 12 weeks|Brachial-ankle plus wave velocity (baPWV)-arterial stiffness, A non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness was conducted using an arterial stiffness device based on pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement. During the test, participants were instructed to lie in a relaxed supine position in a quiet environment. Four blood pressure cuffs were placed on both arms and both ankles. The measurements from the left and right sides were averaged for analysis.The PWV was calculated using the following formula:

PWV = Distance / Pulse Transit Time, Chang from baseline at 12 weeks","Hand grip strength- muscle strength, Participants were instructed to stand with their feet shoulder-width apart, with elbows fully extended and slightly abducted at approximately 45 degrees. They were asked to apply maximum grip strength and hold for 3 to 4 seconds. Each hand was tested three times, with a 10- to 15-second rest between trials. Both hands were tested, and the highest value from each hand was recorded for analysis., Change from baseline at 12 weeks|Five-repetition maximum test (5RM), In this study, exercise intensity was estimated using the five-repetition maximum (5RM) test to predict the one-repetition maximum (1RM). Given that the target population consisted of middle-aged and older postmenopausal women, the 5RM test was selected to reduce the risk of injury and enhance participant motivation.

The predicted 1RM was calculated using the formula proposed by LeSuer et al.:

Alarm signs include weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, dysphagia, and family history of upper gastrointestinal malignancies. FD is a common gastrointestinal complaint. It's prevalence in Iranian population is reported to be from 2.2% to 29.9% (1). FD should be introduced as a disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), together with a simple account of the gut-brain axis and how this is impacted by diet, stress, cognitive, behavioral and emotional responses to symptoms and post-infective changes. Histamine-2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics are introduced as the first line classic treatment in FD. (2) Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) used as gut-brain neuromodulators are an efficacious second-line treatment for FD. (2) Antipsychotics, such as sulpiride 100 mg four times a day or levosulpiride 25 mg three times a day, may be efficacious as a second-line treatment for FD. Tandospirone, Pregabalin, Mirtazapine are among the suggested second line pharmachological therapy. (2) FD expresses a spectrum of various upper gastrointestinal complaints. Epigastric pain, retrosternal pain, regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, belching, dysphagia, and early satiety are among the most frequent symptoms. Therefore, a combination of medications might be needed to alleviate the patients' discomfort. The pharmaceutics have proposed the package of medications to increase the patient compliance.

NCT06958926,A Translational Study for Locoregional Recurrence of T4 Colon Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958926,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The outcome of T4 locally advanced colon cancer is poor when locoregional recurrence occurred. Previous studies had showed that the aggravation of T4 colon cancer is higher than N-positive colon cancer, contributing to staging paradox that outcomes of stage IIB/C are poorer than stage IIIA colon cancer and higher locoregional recurrence of stage IIB/C colon cancer. The phenomenon cannot be explained by radicality, lymph node harvested and adjuvant chemotherapy administration. To elucidate the cancerous aggravation of T4 colon cancer, the investigators should dive into the clinicopathology, metastatic mechanism and cancer biology.

The investigators hypothesize that peritoneal spreading can be one of the metastatic routes of T4 colon cancer; however, few studies have addressed the finding and deserved investigation. Previous research have found that serum epigenetic alterations and cell-free DNA can serve as a prognostic marker for stage II/III colon cancer.

Therefore, the aim of this study is (1) to explore the role of ascites cfDNA as a potential biomolecular marker for locoregional recurrence; (2) to identify the risk factors of locoregional recurrence for T4 colon cancer by correlating biomolecular markers between clinicopathology, epigenomic alterations in blood and ascites.",NO,T4 Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Cancer Stage III|Colorectal Cancer Stage II,PROCEDURE: Radical surgery for colon and rectum cancer|PROCEDURE: Radical surgery for colorectal cancer,"The correlation the cell-free DNA level and sequencing between ascites and serum, One year",,,National Taiwan University Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,60,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,202407175RINC,2025-05-01,2025-12-31,2028-12-31,2025-05-06,,2025-05-06,"National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu branch, Hsinchu, 308, Taiwan",
NCT06958913,Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Hemodynamics in Cardiac Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958913,,COMPLETED,"It is important to establish a stable haemodynamics in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Haemodynamic depression is common during induction of anaesthesia \[1\]. Sympathetic response due to tracheal intubation creates unwanted hypertensive responses on haemodynamics. Dexmedetomidine decreases stress responses and may provide a stable haemodynamics in situations such as surgery or induction of anaesthesia \[2-4\]. It may increase the tendency to hypotension and bradycardia by weakening the hyperdynamic response caused by sympathetic effect \[5,6\]. Concurrent use of dexmedetomidine may reduce anaesthetic opioid doses and provide more stable haemodynamics on systolic arterial pressure in patients undergoing CABG \[7\].

During cardiopulmonary bypass, dexmedetomidine may provide myocardial protection by exerting anti-inflammatory effects and may be beneficial for rapid recovery \[6,8,9\]. In cardiac surgery, dexmedetomidine provided bidirectional regulation of the anti-inflammatory response in which it showed antioxidant properties by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production and lipid peroxidation \[10,11\]. Dexmedetomidine in combination with propofol resulted in lower myocardial enzyme values than propofol alone \[12\]. The cardioprotective effects of propofol are dose-dependent; however, haemodynamic instability may be a concern at higher doses. In addition, dexmedetomidine may be considered a valid alternative to propofol, mainly because of its haemodynamic stability and possible myocardial protective effects \[13\]. It has been shown that dexmedetomidine pretreatment in valvular heart surgery can reduce the dose of propofol and the duration of mechanical ventilation and provide myocardial protection without an increase in adverse events \[14\]. Our study had two aims. The first was to provide a more stable haemodynamics by adding dexmedetomidine to induction in open cardiovascular surgery anaesthesia.

This common condition is treated with iron supplements taken either orally or given through an intravenous (IV) infusion. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is one of the widely used, comparably newer IV iron preparations. Recently, several publications have raised the possibility that FCM may be associated with mild elevations in methemoglobin (metHb), a form of hemoglobin that cannot effectively deliver oxygen to tissues.

Methemoglobinemia is a known, though uncommon, side effect of some drugs. While usually mild and self-limiting, in certain cases it can become clinically significant or even life-threatening. This observational study is being conducted across multiple centers to better understand how often methemoglobinemia occurs after administration of FCM. As part of routine care, venous blood samples will be used to measure metHb levels in patients receiving FCM, and these results will be compared with those from individuals not exposed to the drug.",NO,"Methemoglobinemia|Anemia, Iron-Deficiency|Parenteral Iron Therapy|Ferric Carboxymaltose",DRUG: Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM),"Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Clinically Significant Methemoglobinemia, Methemoglobin levels will be measured just before the infusion and at the 15th and 30th minutes post-infusion through venous sampling.

NCT06958809,Evolution of Tissue Perfusion and Venous Congestion Markers in Fluid-Responsive Septic Shock Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958809,FLUID-IMPACT,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Septic shock remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care, and while fluid resuscitation (FR) is a cornerstone of early management, its benefit-risk balance is highly variable. Excessive fluid administration can cause venous congestion and organ dysfunction, while insufficient resuscitation risks hypoperfusion. Current strategies often rely on fluid responsiveness (i.e., increased cardiac output after fluids), but this does not guarantee improved outcomes, particularly if congestion ensues.

This prospective, multicenter, observational study aims to assess the clinical impact of FR in septic shock patients who are fluid responsive. The primary objective is to evaluate changes in tissue perfusion and venous congestion markers following FR. Patients will be categorized into four response profiles based on the presence or absence of perfusion improvement and congestion worsening.

Secondary objectives include exploring the prognostic implications of each profile (organ dysfunction, mortality), identifying pre-FR predictors of adverse responses, evaluating changes in congestion markers after passive leg raising (PLR), and performing phenotypic clustering and mediation analyses.

Eligible patients are adults with septic shock requiring vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, with confirmed fluid responsiveness via echocardiography. Each patient will undergo standardized pre- and post-FR assessments, including cardiac ultrasound, Doppler of hepatic/portal veins (VeXUS), CVP, perfusion markers, and blood gases.

Data on SOFA scores, organ support duration, and 28-day mortality will be collected. Approximately 170 patients will be enrolled across five ICUs experienced in advanced hemodynamic monitoring. Statistical analyses will include multivariate modeling, clustering, ROC curves, and mediation analyses.

Limited ankle flexibility (""dorsiflexion"" - how far participants can lift their toes toward the shin) may worsen PFP by altering leg movements. This study investigates whether adding ankle flexibility exercises to standard knee-strengthening programs improves outcomes for young adults with PFP. Active adults aged 18-30 with PFP and limited ankle flexibility (measured with a simple tool) are eligible, excluding those with prior knee/ankle surgeries, fractures, or conditions like arthritis. Sixty-four participants will be randomly assigned to either an Exercise + Ankle Training group (standard knee exercises plus targeted ankle training) or an Exercise-Only group for 8 weeks under physiotherapist guidance.

NCT06958731,To Compare the Success Rate of Internal Jugular Vein Catheterization at the First-attempt Between Single-operator Laser-assisted T-shaped Probe and Traditional Ultrasound-guided Out-of-plane Technique in Adults (≥ 18 Years of Age).,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958731,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background: Ultrasound guidance is an important technique to improve the success rate of internal jugular vein catheterization (IJVC) at the first-attempt, however, both long-axis in-plane and short-axis out-of-plane techniques have their own disadvantages. The T-shaped ultrasonic probe invented by us combined with the help of laser positioning and 3D printing manipulator could realize real-time bi-plane guidance of the needle short-axis out-of -plane and long-axis in-plane. With the help of the Single-operator Laser-assisted T-shaped probe, the whole process of needle insertion, guide wire placement and catheter placement can be visualized, which is expected to improve the success rate on the first-attempt.

Objective: The primary outcome was the first-attempt success rate of RIJV catheterization. The completion of the catheterization was defined as the presentation of the CVP waveform on the monitor. The secondary outcomes included the first-attempt success rate of guidewire placement, the procedure time to success within the first-attempt, procedure time to success within the second attempt, overall procedure time, overall success rate, equipment preparation time, location time, number of unintentional penetration events of the posterior wall, average number of adjustments.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center, prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled study enrolled surgical patients over 18 years and older (ASA grade Ⅰ-Ⅲ) who required IJVC in the First Hospital of Jilin University. The exclusion criteria were prior puncture at the same site in the previous month; puncture site injury, infection, or hematoma; peripheral vascular disease; congenital heart disease, hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock, and severe arrhythmia. The participants were randomized into the traditional ultrasound-guidance group or the single-operator Laser-assisted T-shaped probe ultrasound-guidance group. After inducing general anesthesia, ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein catheterization was performed by two experienced operators.

Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to undergo the Single-operator Laser-assisted T-shaped probe group (n = 54) or traditional ultrasound-guided group (n = 54).

Randomization and Trial Procedures: The randomization website (https://www.randomizer.org) was used by the research statistician to generate random unique numbers from 1 to 108, which were then sealed into opaque numbered envelopes with grouping information. The subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to Single-operator Laser-assisted T-shaped probe group or traditional ultrasound-guided group. The operator team that was not involved in any other part of the study, consisted of doctor A and doctor B. These two residents should had participated in clinical work for more than five years and were proficient in the two ultrasound-assisted methods and successfully completed more than 50 cases of alone. In view of the notably different settings of the two techniques, the allocation was not blinded to the operators, equipment assistant, and research assistant. Conversely, the relatives of the subjects were blinded to the group assignment and free to withdraw from the trial at any time. All data were collected and analyzed by the same research assistant.

Statistical Analysis: The sample size required for this study was calculated using PASS 21.0 (NCSS, USA). According to a pilot study in our department, the success rate of the first attempt was 98% in the the T-shaped probe combined with laser group, and according to the relevant literature, the success rate of first-attempt in traditional ultrasound-guided group was 77%. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, the required sample size in the present study was 108 patients per group (two sided α = 0.05; power = 0.90).

Shapiro-wilk test was used to test the normality of measurement data. The measurement data with normal distribution were described by mean ± standard deviation, and the measurement data with non-normal distribution were described by median (lower quartile, upper quartile). Count data were described by frequency (percentage). Independent t-test, χ2 test were used to assess the baseline characteristics of the study population, and GLM analysis was used to adjust the effect of covariates; The main outcome measures were analyzed using the χ2 test. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24 (SPSS Corporation, IBM Corporation, USA).

NCT06958718,Ultrasound vs. Surgical ESP Block With Bupivacaine-Dexmedetomidine in Lumbar Fusion Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958718,,RECRUITING,"Lumbar spine surgery causes intense post-op pain, peaking within 12 hours and improving by day three. Traditional spinal procedures involve extensive tissue dissection, leading to severe pain and potential complications like delayed mobilization, respiratory issues, and chronic pain. Effective pain management is crucial. Opioid-based relief is standard but comes with side effects (nausea, respiratory depression), increasing hospital stays and costs.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that enhances nerve block duration when combined with local anesthetics (LAs). It works by inhibiting sodium and potassium channels, leading to prolonged hyperpolarization.

Regional nerve blocks, such as thoracic epidurals and fascial plane blocks, improve postoperative pain management and help reduce opioid use, minimizing complications. Various techniques, including ESP blocks, paravertebral Block (PVB), and Serratus anterior Block (SAB) have been explored for acute pain relief.

The Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB), initially used for thoracic neuropathic pain, has expanded to thoracic, breast, and abdominal surgeries.

The ESP block is done by injecting a local anesthetic between the transverse process and the erector spinae muscle. Ultrasound guidance helps visualize the spread of the anesthetic and the surrounding anatomy. Previous studies indicate that the ESP block can effectively relieve pain after lumbar spine surgery and may reduce postoperative opioid use when local anesthetics are applied to the wound and deep tissues. Based on this, performing the ESP block directly by the surgical team, using a local anesthetic between the erector spinae muscle and transverse process with direct view and free hand, may yield similar results to the ultrasound guided technique. The current study aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of Ultrasound-Guided Erector Spinae Plane Block in comparison with surgical Erector Spinae Plane Block using a mixture of bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine in lumbar Spinal fusion Surgeries.",NO,Post Operative Pain,PROCEDURE: Ultrasound Guided erector spinae plane block (UB)|PROCEDURE: Surgical erector spinae plane block (SB)|DRUG: Dexmedetomidine|DRUG: Bupivacaine Hcl 0.5% Inj,"QAQStatic VAS score one hour postoperatively., Visual Analog Scale (VAS) tool used to measure pain of patients after surgery, consist of 100mm length scale where 0 = ""no pain"" and 100 = ""worst imaginable pain"". static VAS score to be obtained one hour after surgery., one hour after surgery","Postoperative static VAS scores., Visual Analog Scale (VAS) tool used to measure pain of patients after surgery, consist of 100mm length scale where 0 = ""no pain"" and 100 = ""worst imaginable pain"". static VAS score to be obtained at 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours after the block., At 48 hours after the block|Postoperative dynamic VAS scores., Visual Analog Scale (VAS) tool used to measure pain of patients after surgery, consist of 100mm length scale where 0 = ""no pain"" and 100 = ""worst imaginable pain"".

Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted on patients receiving definitive cCRT. The radiation therapy technique uses intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and involves field irradiation. It protects more normal tissue from exposure.Chemotherapy regimens included platinum-based doublet combinations: etoposide plus cisplatin (every 28 days), pemetrexed plus platinum (every 21 days), or paclitaxel plus platinum (weekly, only for control group) .

Patients were followed up at one month post-treatment, then every three months for the two year, and every six months thereafter until disease progression.

Rhinoplasty is now one of the most common rhinological procedures with both functional and aesthetic aspects. Tip plasty is considered the core of rhinoplasty. The interaction among lower lateral cartilages, septal cartilage, adjacent soft tissues, tissue dynamics, and surgical techniques determines the nasal tips projection, rotation, and overall shape. Various graft sources and types were used for tip support in rhinoplasty such as columellar struts, septal extensions, and cap grafts.

The columellar strut graft, first introduced in 1932, has became a widely adopted technique. Typically a cartilage graft is positioned between the medial crura to provide support and stability to the nasal tip.

Complications arise primarily from hypoventilation, which leads to atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
* Key to Reducing Complications: Pain Control Effective analgesia is the cornerstone of preventing respiratory complications. Inadequate pain relief causes patients to splint and hypoventilate, setting the stage for pulmonary collapse and infection.
* Conservative Management
* Analgesics: Systemic pharmacological pain relief remains the mainstay.
* Supportive Measures: Rest, application of ice, and encouragement of deep breathing exercises.
* Incentive Spirometry: Promoted in all patients to maintain lung expansion and ward off atelectasis.
* Regional Anesthesia Techniques

To further improve comfort and respiratory mechanics, ultrasound-guided nerve blocks are employed according to fracture location:

* Serratus Anterior Plane Block for anterolateral rib fractures
* Thoracic Paravertebral Block for posterior rib fractures
* Surgical Intervention Reserved for complex cases-such as flail chest or fractures with risk of organ injury-where stabilization or repair may be necessary.

NCT06958406,Neural Mechanism of Cerebrocardiac Syndrome Following Traumatic Brain Injury,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958406,,RECRUITING,"Cerebrocardiac syndrome (CCS), including myocardial injury, arrhythmia or heart failure is one of serious complications of traumatic brain injury (TBI), mostly occurs within seven days after TBI, which directly aggravates the brain damage and affects the prognosis of TBI patients. Accumulative evidences suggest that autonomic nervous system disorder is a key initiation point for CCS, but how TBI affects the specific action patterns is not yet clear. Therefore, elucidating the neural mechanisms of TBI-induced CCS, maintaining the central sympathetic-parasympathetic balance through novel interventions such as noninvasive brain stimulation, may fundamentally block the downstream peripheral mechanism, thus achieving effective prevention and treatment for CCS. Based on the current emerging research in brain connectomics and lesion-symptom mapping, we speculate that cerebral contusions can cause structural or functional disconnection of key nodes in the central autonomic nervous system regulatory network, thereby mediating the occurrence of TBI-induced CCS.

In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or functional MRI (fMRI) examinations were performed in patients with mild or moderate TBI with aim to explore the association between structural and functional disconnection caused by cerebral contusion and TBI-induced CCS, and to screen out the neural anatomical structures to predict CCS following TBI, providing therapy targets for prevention and treatment of CCS.",NO,Traumatic Brain Injury|Cerebrocardiac Syndrome,,"Brain network evaluation by MRI, MRI data of all participants are acquired within 3 days after enrollment, and the MRI scans include one or more of the following contents：

NCT06958393,Effect of Opioid-free Anaesthesia on Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Gastrointestinal Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958393,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common acute and transient form of brain dysfunction in elderly patients following surgery that can lead to serious adverse clinical outcomes and even death. Although existing studies have preliminarily investigated the effects of opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) on POD, high-quality evidence on these effects for elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery remains limited. This study aims to investigate the effects of OFA on the development of POD in elderly patients following gastrointestinal surgery.

Methods and analysis:

This single-centre, prospective, randomized controlled trial will be conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, China. A total of 406 patients aged 65 years or older who are scheduled for elective gastrointestinal surgery will be randomly allocated to receive either opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA; dexmedetomidine, esmolol, and esketamine) or conventional opioid-based anaesthesia (OBA). The primary outcome is the incidence of POD 7 days after surgery. The secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality within 30 days after surgery, intraoperative haemodynamic changes, the 15-item quality of recovery (QoR-15) scores at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after surgery, complications during postoperative hospitalization, pain numerical rating scale (NRS) score at 72 h after surgery, incidence of nausea and vomiting at 72 h after surgery, morphine milligram equivalent for analgesics at 72 h after surgery, duration of anaesthesia (from induction to discontinuation), duration of surgery (from skin incision to the last suture), duration of post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, and length of hospital stay.

Discussion:

The results of this study may shed light on the effects of OFA on POD in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. The study is designed on the basis of the following key hypothesis: the use of opioid drugs for anaesthesia may increase the risk of POD through mechanisms such as blood-brain barrier destruction, neuroinflammatory responses, and central nervous system depression. Through the single-centre and prospective design of this randomized controlled trial, this study will directly analyse differences in the effects of OFA and conventional OBA on the incidence of POD, haemodynamic stability and long-term cognitive function in elderly patients.

NCT06958289,Cryoneurolysis for Spasticity Treatment: Long-term Clinical Outcomes and Mechanisms in the Central Nervous System,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958289,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Spasticity can make regular daily activities difficult or impossible. Cryoneurolysis is a new technique to treat spasticity that is currently being tested. For this technique, a needle is inserted alongside a nerve implicated in spasticity. The needle then freezes and causes the nerve to break down. The nerve breaking down seems to provide relief for spasticity. The investigators are interested in testing the long-term effects of cryoneurolysis on the function of the brain over six months after treatment. The investigators are testing the brain's function using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which involves a magnet activating specific parts of the brain that cause muscles to fire; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which uses to examine brain structure; functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine brain function. The investigators believe that there will be a change in these measures that are related to the long-lasting effects of cryoneurolysis. Cryoneurolysis is not a part of standard care after stroke but is approved in Canada for patients. It has been used extensively in the past for treating pain. TMS is a way of studying how the brain sends signals to muscles to make movement. During these sessions, a researcher will use a magnet to turn on specific neurons in the brain that will cause muscles to contract. The investigators can study the way eyes and muscles respond to better understand how the brain is sending information about moving the body to the muscles. FNIRS is a new way of studying how the brain works. During these sessions, a researcher will fit the participant with a cap that has several lights on it. The light travels through hair, scalp, and skull where it interacts with blood in the brain. By studying the changes in the colour of the blood in the brain, researchers can understand which parts of the brain are active during specific tasks. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) involves a powerful magnet that takes very detailed pictures of the brain. These images help the investigators to understand how a stroke is related to spasticity. Also, these images are helpful to make the stimulation with TMS more accurate. Study participation will require five visits to the Parkwood Institute Main Building and one visit to St. Joseph's Hospital. The entire study will take place over roughly six months.

NCT06958276,Effect of US-Guided PNM in CrossFit With Nonspecific Shoulder Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958276,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"CrossFit is a high-intensity physical training program that combines exercises from various disciplines, such as weightlifting, track and field, running, and gymnastics. The three main characteristics of this sport discipline are as follows: first, the execution of functional movements; second, performing them at high intensity; and lastly, constant variation. This training model has shown improvements in strength, power, balance, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory capacities.

There are various risk factors described in the literature that may lead to injuries in CrossFit athletes. It has been suggested that demanding training programs increase this risk, especially when performed incorrectly (poor technique). Additionally, excessive training load and frequency can lead to early fatigue, greater perceived effort, and risky movement execution.

On the other hand, older age, male sex, and previous injuries also appear to be relevant risk factors, as well as performing stretches prior to CrossFit practice. Several studies have shown that the shoulder is the joint with the highest prevalence of injury in this sport, surpassing other commonly affected joints such as the lumbar spine or the knee.

Among the wide variety of injuries related to the shoulder, the diagnosis of ""nonspecific shoulder pain"" has a high prevalence in the adult population. This term is used to describe clinical cases where it is not possible to identify the specific cause of the pain, and is justified by its multifactorial etiology, which is associated with several risk factors. These include: imbalance in the strength ratio between internal and external rotators, limitations in rotational mobility of the glenohumeral joint, deficits in motor control of the scapular musculature, shoulder muscle fatigue, and the repetitive execution of overhead exercises.

This last factor is especially relevant in the CrossFit population, as such movements are frequent in the discipline. Repeated overhead exercises have been associated with a deficit in glenohumeral internal rotation. From a biomechanical perspective, this movement is more efficient when accompanied by external rotation, so internal rotation limitation can compromise the motion. This deficit has been linked to modifiable musculoskeletal factors such as posterior capsule stiffness, shortening of the infraspinatus or teres minor muscles, and scapular mechanics alterations, as well as non-modifiable factors like bone torsion observed in young athletes. These conditions can lead to pain and/or glenoid labrum pathology.

Regarding the clinical management of nonspecific shoulder pain, conservative physiotherapy treatment is the most common approach. This is based on manual therapy and therapeutic exercise. However, in recent years, invasive physiotherapy has gained popularity in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders through techniques such as ultrasound-guided percutaneous neuromodulation (US-guided PNM). This technique involves delivering electrical stimulation through an acupuncture needle placed near the nerve (epineurium) or the motor point of the target muscle, aiming to restore proper functionality of pathological neuromuscular structures.

US-guided PNM, applied to both the lower and upper limbs, has shown effectiveness in both healthy individuals and subjects with various musculoskeletal disorders, improving pain, strength, flexibility, and normalization of neural excitability.

Currently, there are therapeutic exercise protocols used for both evaluation and treatment of nonspecific shoulder pain in CrossFit athletes. Additionally, there are US-guided PNM protocols that have been applied to healthy CrossFit athletes and have demonstrated improvements in shoulder rotational strength. However, US-guided PNM has not yet been studied in a population of CrossFit athletes with nonspecific shoulder pain. Therefore, this randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two different US-guided PNM protocols, analyzing which methodology is most appropriate for reducing the risk factors associated with the development of nonspecific shoulder pain in CrossFit athletes.",NO,Nonspecific Shoulder Pain|Shoulder Pain Syndrome,OTHER: Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Neuromodulation.

The participant was positioned according to the instructions of Hams et al., seated with the hip and knee flexed at 90 degrees, feet flat on the floor, trunk upright, shoulder at 0 degrees of abduction and neutral rotation, and elbow in contact with the trunk, flexed at 90 degrees. The dynamometer was placed on the distal third of the inner forearm to assess internal rotation (IR) and on the distal third of the outer forearm to assess external rotation (ER). Athletes were instructed to produce the maximum isometric force for 10 seconds, while the evaluator applied the same force in the opposite direction. Three tests were performed bilaterally, with a one-minute rest between each test, and the final data was the average of the three tests. The strength ratio was calculated by dividing ER/IR, with 2:3 (0.66) considered the ideal ratio., The measurements were taken pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention.","Glenohumeral rotational mobility, A digital goniometer (HALO), which has demonstrated validity and reliability for measurements in the shoulder joint, was used. For each participant, bilateral internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) were measured. Subsequently, both rotations were summed to create a third variable: the total rotational movement arc (ART). The patient was placed in the supine position, with the shoulder abducted at 90 degrees, the elbow flexed at 90 degrees, and the forearm perpendicular to the floor. An evaluator stabilized the scapula by applying pressure to the coracoid process, while another evaluator performed passive internal/external rotation and placed the goniometer on the distal third of the forearm on its dorsal side. Passive mobilization was completed when the first ""end-feel"" was reached or when the scapula began to move. Two measurements of each rotation were taken on each shoulder, and the final data was the average of both measurements., The measurements were taken pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention.|Scapular motor control, A surface electromyograph from the commercial brand Mdurance, which has been validated and used in the literature, was used.

Therefore, surface electrodes were placed bilaterally on the three muscles mentioned, and the athlete was asked to perform five repetitions of glenohumeral abduction in the scapular plane. The electromyograph software recorded the activation level of the three muscles, as well as the order of activation of the musculature., The measurements were taken pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention.",,Universidad de Zaragoza,Aragon Institute for Health Research (IIS Aragón),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,42,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","NMP-e, CrossFit, dolor hombro",2025-06-01,2025-07-01,2025-07-01,2025-05-06,,2025-05-09,"University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, 50009, Spain",
NCT06958263,Relationship Between Low Back Pain and Sensitization,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958263,,RECRUITING,"Chronic non-specific low back pain is a common health problem that significantly affects the quality of life of individuals. Increased pain intensity leads to deficiencies in the body's sensory organization, resulting in decreased awareness. This can lead to dysfunction in body awareness, which is known as the ability of individuals to perceive the sensations and conditions of their bodies. Body awareness plays a critical role in pain management and mobility. Chronic pain causes constant stimulation in the nervous system, causing central sensitization, which is when the central nervous system becomes overly sensitive to pain signals. As a result, a decrease in the pain threshold, constant pain, and increased muscle tension occur. Increased pain intensity and decreased awareness can result in a decrease in the maintenance of optimal functions, affecting muscular endurance. Inadequate muscular endurance can increase low back pain and make it difficult for individuals to perform their daily activities.

NCT06958237,Salicylic Acid Wart Patch for the Treatment of Common Warts and Plantar Warts,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958237,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Common and plantar warts are a type of skin lesion caused by infection with the human papilloma virus. The incidence of warts is relatively high, with an estimated few to several per cent of the adult population affected. An even higher incidence of dermal warts is reported in the child and adolescent population, where it reaches nearly twenty per cent. The human papilloma virus (HPV) multiplies in the epidermal cells, leading to the formation of a skin lesion with a hyperkeratotic, uneven surface, called a wart. HPV infection can lead to various types of warts: including common warts, plantar warts, flat warts or condyloma acuminatum. Warts belong to skin lesions of a benign and self-limiting nature. Because of this, treatment of warts is often not applied. However, it is necessary to emphasise that warts, including in particular plantar warts, can be a source of pain as well as lead to psychological discomfort for the patient. Additionally, untreated warts are a potential source of subsequent infections.

For this reason, a variety of methods are used to treat warts, with the primary aim of removing the layer of diseased epidermis, as well as limiting the spread of the virus. The methods used to treat warts can be divided according to the nature of the agent used in the treatment - physical or chemical. Physical methods include cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and surgical or laser wart removal. Chemical methods for the treatment of warts will be the use of ointments and solutions of substances such as salicylic acid, 5-fluorouracil, glycolic acid or purine acid. In addition, the treatment of warts also includes methods based on an occlusive action, involving the use of a barrier that shields the skin lesion and stops the spread of the virus.

This protocol concerns a study of salicylic acid wart patches. The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of their use in the treatment of common and plantar warts. The patches allow covering the lesion and the salicylic acid contained in them at a concentration of 40% has a keratolytic action allowing exfoliation of excessive epidermal proliferation caused by HPV infection. In addition, the mass of the product includes lanolin, which has an epidermal softening effect. The patches are intended for a patient population over six years of age, with common and plantar warts. The primary endpoints analysed in the study will be reduction in lesion size (assessed by dermatoscopic measurement), change in the number of warts in the area of the main wart-like lesion, occurrence of further dermal wart-like lesions in the treated area and incidence of adverse reactions.

NCT06958042,The Prevalence of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Individuals With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06958042,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined as a chronic lung disease characterised by progressive airflow limitation and chronic respiratory symptoms due to structural changes in the airways. Dyspnoea (shortness of breath), chronic cough and increased sputum production are the most common symptoms in individuals with COPD. Respiratory diseases are considered a risk factor for lower urinary tract symptoms due to cough and shortness of breath. Severe coughing and shortness of breath increase intra-abdominal pressure and stress on the bladder. This can lead to leakage if the pelvic floor muscles are weak. In addition, regular coughing can further weaken the ligaments in the pelvic floor, causing symptoms.

Lower urinary tract symptoms is a general term covering various functional disorders of the bladder, pelvic floor or specific pathologies. The International Continence Society classifies lower urinary tract symptoms in three main groups: storage (increased/decreased urination, urinary incontinence, nocturia, overactive bladder), emptying (delayed urination, painful urination, intermittent urination) and post-emptying (feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, repeated urge to urinate, urinary tract infections). When the current literature was examined, it was observed that there are studies on the presence of urinary incontinence in patients with chronic respiratory disease, but there are limited studies investigating the presence and effects of lower urinary system symptoms in individuals with COPD in general, and investigating the level of pelvic floor health knowledge.

NCT06957808,Investigating the Effect of Diroximel Fumarate on Glutathione in Schizophrenia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06957808,FORTUNE,RECRUITING,"Schizophrenia is a condition that causes symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, reduced motivation and muddled thinking. It is a common, severe and disabling psychiatric illness affecting about 1/100 (1%) of people. It is ranked the third most disabling illness worldwide. Six in seven patients do not recover from the illness in 6-12 months and continue to experience psychotic symptoms. Therefore, there is a strong unmet need for new evidence-based treatments to target the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia. There is increasing evidence to indicate that glutathione (GSH), the main brain antioxidant, is abnormal in schizophrenia and may provide a new treatment target. In this study we plan to determine whether Diroximel Fumarate (DRF) (currently a treatment for a brain disorder called multiple sclerosis) can increase GSH in the brain of patients with schizophrenia using a brain scan (MRI) and explore whether changes in GSH are related to other brain measures (measured with MRI and EEG- which measures electrical activity in the brain), blood markers of GSH, and symptoms. During this study 30 people with schizophrenia will be recruited. They will take the drug DRF for two weeks, a computer will then decide randomly whether each person will continue to take DRF or a placebo/dummy pill for another two weeks. During this part of the study neither the patients nor the researchers will know which type of drug the patient is taking. Brain GSH and the other measures described will be assessed before and after taking the DRF and placebo/dummy pill.

Weakness in these muscles can lead to dysfunctions such as pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence (UI), and sexual or anorectal disorders. UI, defined as the involuntary loss of urine, is common globally and classified as stress, urge, or mixed incontinence. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) - the most prevalent type among women - occurs during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure. Risk factors include female sex, aging, obesity, smoking, chronic constipation, previous gynecological surgeries, and childbirth. Treatment options for SUI include conservative and surgical methods. Pelvic floor training (PFT), first described by Arnold Kegel in 1948, is a conservative approach that strengthens PFM and alleviates symptoms.

Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy has emerged as a potential treatment modality for patients with extensive PM, allowing for higher local drug concentrations while minimizing systemic toxicity. However, current response evaluation methods, such as CT scans, have low sensitivity for detecting PM, and second-look laparoscopy, although more accurate, is invasive and unsuitable for repeated assessments. The ⁶⁸Ga-FAPI PET/CT scan offers a promising non-invasive alternative for assessing peritoneal response to IP chemotherapy. This imaging technique targets the fibroblast activation protein, which is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts within the tumor microenvironment. Early studies have shown that ⁶⁸Ga-FAPI PET/CT is a highly sensitive too in detecting peritoneal metastases. Given these advantages, the investigators hypothesize that ⁶⁸Ga-FAPI PET/CT could improve the evaluation of treatment response in patients undergoing IP chemotherapy for PM, offering a non-invasive and accurate alternative to current methods.

The study also aims to understand how the body responds to heat stress during pregnancy and how this might lead to pregnancy complications and birth problems like early birth or low birth weight.

The main questions that the study aims to answer are:

1. What are the acute and chronic effects of environmental heat exposure on pregnancy and birth outcomes across different trimesters?
2. Through which biological pathways does heat stress impact maternal, fetal, and infant health across varying gestational ages?
3. How do socio-demographic factors, maternal characteristics, and nutritional status of women modify the relationship between environmental heat exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes?

The study will take place in rural parts of Sindh, Pakistan. These areas often experience extreme heat and have limited access to electricity or cooling systems like fans or air conditioners.

This study will include pregnant women who are in their first trimester (under 14 weeks of pregnancy). Before starting any study activities, researchers will explain the study to each woman in a language she understands and ask for her written permission to take part (informed consent).

At the beginning of the study, participants will visit a study clinic. During this visit, researchers will check their height and weight, perform an ultrasound, and collect a small amount of blood for testing. Participants will also be asked to wear a small device that measures the air temperature and humidity in their surroundings.

The researchers will follow each participant during her pregnancy, with visits during the second and third trimesters at the study clinic. At each visit, researchers will check how much heat the participant has been exposed to using the data from the device and from her own answers to a simple questionnaire. The questionnaire will have questions about their heat exposure at work, home, type of clothing, and how they deal with hot weather. Serial ultrasound, blood and urine tests will be conducted so researchers can study signs of stress, hydration, and other changes in the body. A smaller group of participants will also wear a device to measure their body skin temperature, heart rate, physical activity and sleep during pregnancy.

When the baby is born, researchers will collect information about the birth, including the baby's weight and length, the time of delivery, and whether there were any complications during birth. After delivery, both the mother and baby will be followed for up to 12 months. During this time, the research team will check the health of both the mother and baby and see how heat exposure during pregnancy may affect the baby's growth over time.

This study does not involve any treatment or medicine. Instead, researchers will observe the participants to learn how real-life heat exposure affects them during pregnancy.

NCT06957587,A Prediction Model of Basic Blood Volume Based on Hemodynamics and Ultrasound,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06957587,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"1. Research Background

   Effective blood volume management is critical in perioperative and critical care settings, as both hypovolemia and hypervolemia can lead to severe complications, including organ dysfunction, hemodynamic instability, and increased mortality. Traditional methods of assessing blood volume, such as central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, have significant limitations, including poor sensitivity and delayed responsiveness to dynamic changes in intravascular volume status.

   In recent years, continuous hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., LiDCO) and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) have emerged as promising tools for real-time blood volume assessment. The LiDCO system provides dynamic parameters such as stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which are highly sensitive to fluid responsiveness. Meanwhile, inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound offers non-invasive measurements of IVC diameter, cross-sectional area (CSA), and collapsibility index (IVC-CI), which correlate with intravascular volume status.

   Despite these advances, no integrated model currently combines continuous hemodynamic and IVC ultrasound parameters to predict blood volume quantitatively. Most existing approaches rely on either static measurements (e.g., CVP) or single-modality dynamic indices (e.g., SVV alone), which may not fully capture the complex interplay between vascular tone, cardiac function, and circulating blood volume.
2. Current Research Status 2.1 Hemodynamic Monitoring in Blood Volume Assessment

   The LiDCO system, based on pulse contour analysis, provides real-time hemodynamic data that are strongly associated with fluid responsiveness. Studies have demonstrated that SVV \>10-13% and PPV \>12% reliably predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. However, these parameters are influenced by factors such as cardiac arrhythmias, spontaneous breathing, and vasopressor use, limiting their standalone predictive accuracy.

   2.2 IVC Ultrasound in Volume Status Evaluation

   IVC ultrasound has gained traction as a rapid, non-invasive method for assessing volume status. Key parameters include:

   IVC maximum diameter (IVCmax): A distended IVC (\>2 cm) suggests volume overload, while a collapsed IVC (\<1.5 cm) indicates hypovolemia.

   IVC collapsibility index (IVC-CI): Calculated as (IVCmax - IVCmin)/IVCmax × 100%, an IVC-CI \>50% is highly predictive of fluid responsiveness.

   IVC cross-sectional area (IVC-CSA): Emerging evidence suggests that IVC-CSA changes may better reflect intravascular volume than diameter alone.

   2.3 Limitations of Existing Models

   Current blood volume assessment methods suffer from:

   Lack of integration: Most studies analyze hemodynamic and ultrasound parameters separately rather than combining them into a unified predictive model.

   Qualitative rather than quantitative assessment: While SVV and IVC-CI can indicate fluid responsiveness, they do not provide an absolute blood volume estimation.

NCT06957522,Comparison of the Effectiveness of Face to Face Rehabilitation and Telerehabilitation in Infants With Congenital Muscular Torticollis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06957522,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Who is this study for? This study is designed for infants aged 0-6 months who have been diagnosed with Congenital Muscular Torticollis (CMT). CMT is a condition observed at birth or shortly after, characterized by the shortening of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, leading to the baby's head tilting to one side and rotating to the opposite side. It affects both boys and girls and may result in limited neck movement, abnormal posture, facial asymmetry, and potential developmental delays if left untreated.

What is the purpose of this study? The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different physical therapy methods-face-to-face rehabilitation and telerehabilitation-in treating infants with CMT. In addition to evaluating the outcomes of these two therapy methods, this research also aims to provide families with reliable, accessible information through a web-based educational platform.

Why is this study important? Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for optimal recovery in infants with CMT. Studies show that infants who begin therapy by one month of age have up to a 98% chance of full recovery. However, if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the recovery process can take longer and may be less effective. This study will help determine if online (telerehabilitation) sessions can be just as effective as traditional face-to-face therapy, offering a flexible and accessible treatment option for families.

What are the benefits of participating?

* Access to a structured, evidence-based rehabilitation program for your child
* Guidance from trained pediatric physiotherapists
* Increased awareness and knowledge about CMT through a web-based family education platform
* Contribution to research that may benefit other children and families in the future
* Evaluation of your baby's progress through professional assessments

What will the therapy program involve?

Participants will be randomly assigned to either a face-to-face or telerehabilitation group. Both groups will follow the same therapy program, focusing on:

* Increasing passive and active neck movements
* Promoting symmetrical head and body movement
* Providing recommendations for environmental adjustments
* Educating parents or caregivers on home-based exercises and care

Program structure:

* Face-to-face group: Therapy sessions will be conducted in a clinic setting, twice a week for 30 minutes each session, over a period of 8 weeks.
* Telerehabilitation group: Therapy sessions will be conducted via Zoom, with the same frequency, duration, and content as the face-to-face sessions.

How will outcomes be measured?

Infants will be assessed before and after the 8-week therapy period for:

* Passive cervical range of motion (rotation and lateral flexion)
* Gross motor function
* Muscle function Parental adherence to the home program will also be evaluated through a questionnaire. A follow-up will be conducted one month after therapy ends.

How can I participate? If your infant is aged 0-6 months and has been diagnosed with CMT, you may be eligible to participate. You will need access to a device with internet for telerehabilitation sessions, if assigned to that group. Participation is voluntary and free of charge. Families will receive detailed instructions and ongoing support throughout the program.

Additional Resources:

As part of this study, a web-based educational platform will be made available to all participating families. This platform will include:

* Clear explanations about CMT
* Instructional videos and home exercise guides
* Tips for daily care and positioning
* Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for parents Why is this research unique? This is one of the first studies to scientifically compare face-to-face and online rehabilitation for CMT infants, while also providing a reliable online resource for families. It aims to help develop alternative, flexible care models that meet the diverse needs of families and infants.

NCT06957483,Pilot Study of a Sedentary Behaviour Intervention for Individuals With a Spinal Cord Injury,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06957483,REACH-SCI,RECRUITING,"Individuals with spinal cord injury have a greater risk of heart disease and stroke than non-disabled individuals. This might be partly because wheelchair users engage in high amounts of sedentary behaviour. A review found a lack of programmes aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour in individuals with paraplegia. This means we do not know how good these programmes are for reducing heart disease risk markers.

A programme to support reductions in sedentary behaviour has been co-designed with individuals with paraplegia, healthcare professionals, and people who support individuals with paraplegia in the community.

This study aims to evaluate the new programme to determine its acceptability, fidelity, safety and preliminary efficacy.

The Reducing sedEntary Activities to improve Cardiovascular Health in individuals with Spinal Cord Injury (REACH -SCI) intervention will last eight weeks and involve (1) a wearable activity tracker to give reminders to break up sedentary behaviour, (2) education around what sedentary behaviour is, how to reduce and break up sedentary behaviour, and the benefits of doing so, (3) a goal setting worksheet related to sedentary behaviour, (4) one-to-one motivational support sessions to help set goals, review progress and give motivation, (5) peer support using a group chat with other participants in a smartphone messaging app , and (6) activity tools (exercise bands and a handcycle) to support breaking up sedentary behaviour throughout the day.

Measurements of fatigue, pain, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, heart disease risk markers, wellbeing, anxiety, depression and quality of life will be taken at baseline before the programme starts and then again after the programme ends.

The main questions the platform trial aims to answer are:

* Does any tau-directed therapy, alone or in combination with donanemab, reduce brain tau deposition more than donanemab alone?
* Does any tau-directed therapy, alone or in combination with donanemab, slow disease progression based on fluid biomarkers, imaging, or clinical measures?

* Be randomized to a treatment regimens, each containing different tau therapies. The exact number of treatment regimens that will active at the time of screening will change over time.
* Receive donanemab or placebo for 6 months, followed by 24 months of tau therapy alone or in combination with donanemab
* Undergo regular cognitive testing, brain scans (MRI/PET), and biomarker assessments over 30 months

These spinal adjuncts are used to extend analgesia in addition to lessening the negative effects of local anesthetics. According to a number of studies, when given intrathecally, α2 receptor agonists will increase the analgesia that subtherapeutic doses of local anesthetics like bupivacaine deliver because of their synergistic effects with little hemodynamic effects.The goal will be to determine if bupivacaine and fentanyl or bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine produced higher-quality anesthesia.",NO,Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL),PROCEDURE: Intrathecal Fentanyl Group (F)|PROCEDURE: intrathecal dexmedetomidine group(D),"to evaluate patient satisfaction, The level of patient's satisfaction was measured using five-point Likert scale ((1 = very dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = neutral, 4 = satisfied, and 5 = very satisfied), at the end of the surgery (assessed up to 40 minutes)|to evaluate the sedation grade, 5- Ramsay Sedation Score

NCT06957288,The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Death Psychoeducation Program on Death Awareness and Death Anxiety Levels in Nurses,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06957288,,RECRUITING,"Nurses are the primary caregivers for individuals who experience difficult situations (disease, loss, etc.) or are in the terminal phase. This may cause nurses to be exposed to the same experiences secondarily. Coming face to face with death can be a traumatic experience for individuals. Whether death is a traumatic experience for nurses may vary depending on individual differences and environmental conditions. Factors affecting nurses in this sense include the unit they work in, death anxiety, death awareness, workload, and sociodemographic characteristics. Studies conducted with nurses indicate that nurses' death anxiety varies depending on the unit and other factors, and that nurses need training for death awareness and the right approach to individuals. A study conducted on death education and grief counseling determined that individuals' participation in death education does not always help them cope with death and grief, but that individuals can be significantly helped in the face of death and loss if individual differences in coping with grief are focused on and helping skills are developed.

It is thought that the awareness-based death-themed psychoeducation program to be applied to nurses in line with their educational needs will increase nurses' death awareness and reduce their death anxiety levels. The nurses working at Kastamonu Education and Research Hospital will constitute the universe of the study. The research will be conducted with nurses in a pre-test-post-test, experimental and control group experimental design. A power analysis will be conducted to determine the number of people to be included in the sample.

It will be calculated with G\*Power 3.1 program. In the sample calculation, effect size (d=1.1), 5% margin of error (α=0.05) and power (1-β=0.95) were taken into account and 30 people were needed in the groups, 15 experimental and 15 control. However, considering the data loss, the sample size for each group was increased by 20% and it was planned to include 18 people in each group, a total of 36 people in the sample. In addition to descriptive statistical methods (Mean, Standard deviation) in the evaluation of the data, correlation test will be used to evaluate the relationship between the mean scores before and after the education in the comparison of quantitative data. Wilcoxon Associated Sample Test will be used to make comparisons before and after the education. ''Nurses Descriptive Information Form'', ''Multidimensional Death Awareness Scale'' and ''Thorson Powell Death Anxiety Scale'' will be used in the collection of data. A mindfulness-based psychoeducation program will be applied to the experimental group. The aim of the psychoeducation is to reduce the death anxiety of the nurses and to increase their awareness of death by providing them with information about the death experience they are secondarily exposed to (1- Death process and death anxiety, 2- Effects of the death process on the individual and family, 3- Coping with the death process, 4- Effects of the death process on caregiving nurses, 5- Awareness of death, 6- Nursing care and emotional competence during the death process).

NCT06957119,Prognosis and Management of Infective Endocarditis Using the Clinical Data Warehouse From AP-HP,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06957119,ENDO-EDS,COMPLETED,"""Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but severe condition with significant morbidity and mortality, with in-hospital mortality reaching 20% and 1-year mortality up to 40%. The epidemiological profile of IE has profoundly changed in recent years, both in terms of responsible microorganisms and affected populations, shifting from young adults with post-rheumatic valvulopathy to older populations with degenerative valve disease or prosthetic implants. Prophylaxis and management recommendations have also evolved, underscoring the importance of monitoring the evolution of IE profiles in France.

Despite these changes, there is no standardized surveillance for IE in France, and existing studies often rely on data from specialized centers, introducing selection biases. Moreover, another important limitation when studying IE using medical-administrative basis, like the french nationwide claims database (SNDS), is the poor performances of administrative coding (ICD-10) in accurately identifying IE cases.

The """"ENDO-EDS"""" project aims to leverage the extensive data available in the APHP Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) to study IE in a real-world, unbiased context. Indeed, the AP-HP clinical data warehouse, with 11 million patients, offers the opportunity to identify IE cases across a large population base and, due to the presence of both expert and non-expert IE hospitals, to describe the characteristics of the disease while reducing bias risks. In addition, AP-HP CDW contains medical reports and other documents emitted during patient' stays in hospital, thus enabling to overcome ICD-10 coding limitations, by utilizing a large-scale clinical data repository combined with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.

The anticipated benefits include improving knowledge of the epidemiological profile of IE, describing diagnostic and therapeutic management practices, and studying their impact on patient prognosis. These efforts aim to contribute to the improvement of IE diagnosis and management in France. The results will be published as scientific articles in open-access peer-reviewed journals. Additionally, the development and validation of algorithms based on automated language processing for identifying patients with IE within the AP-HP data warehouse could be shared to extend subsequent analyses to other French or even European health data warehouses.""",NO,Endocarditis Infective,,"All-cause mortality defined 1 year after the date of IE diagnosis (T0 = Date of diagnostic echocardiography), 1 year after the date of IE diagnosis (T0 = Date of diagnostic echocardiography)","Rate of patients who benefited from imaging procedures performed in the acute phase of IE (within 6 weeks following T0) identified from CCAM codes, ""First-line examinations: transthoracic echocardiography (TTE); (DZQM005, DZQM006); transesophageal echocardiography (TEE); (DZQJ006, DZQJ001); TTE + TEE (DZQJ008)

Methods: For the AI Intervention group, the patients will be trained to independently use the diabetes telemedicine platform application. Each patient will be equipped with a glucometer and exercise bracelet, and the data will be automatically transmitted to the medical server via Bluetooth. The healthcare platform will analyze the uploaded data and provide feedback suggestions on medication, diet, and exercise automatically. The platform will also monitor the medical and lifestyle data of the patients every two weeks, offer feedback based on the analyses, and remind the patient to adhere to the self-management protocol based on the platform. The platform is a digitally integrated healthcare platform that patients can use independently without the need for monitoring and assistance by healthcare professionals. The glucometer and pedometer bracelet will automatically connect to the platform through Bluetooth. The patient lab sheet identification and structured conversion system, AI for food picture identification and calorie calculation systems, and the AI decision-making system are on the cloud server. Patients upload image information, such as lab sheets and meal pictures, through the patient's diabetes mobile health system, and the cloud platform intelligently analyzes the patient's disease, medication, and daily life status to develop personalized solutions according to individual control goals. Free outpatient visits will be provided to both the intervention and control groups every twelve weeks. For the conventional treatment group, patients will receive a free blood glucometer and will have regular outpatient appointments. There is no limit to the number of outpatient visits; however, they are required to regularly monitor and record their blood glucose, diet, and exercise data to ensure that the medical team objectively conduct their diagnosis and treatment activities. The medical team will provide free outpatient visits every 12 weeks, along with advice on medication, diet, and exercise based on the individual's blood glucose level.

NCT06956898,"The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Intervention and Haptonomy Application on Birth Self-Efficacy, Prenatal Attachment and Anxiety Levels of Pregnant Women With Fear of ChildBirth",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956898,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Fear of childbirth is a common condition encountered during pregnancy. Women with fear of childbirth have reduced birth self-efficacy, and it leads to mental health problems in the prenatal and postnatal periods, reducing mother-infant bonding. Therefore, it is of critical importance to implement effective and applicable interventions focused on health and well-being to reduce fear of childbirth. Considering the increasing cesarean section rates today, holistic intervention strategies that can positively affect the birth experiences of pregnant women and support their psychological well-being are needed. In this sense, mindfulness and haptonomy applications, which are holistic intervention strategies, will allow us to meet the psychological and emotional needs of pregnant women with fear of childbirth and improve their birth experiences.

No study has been found in the literature that systematically evaluates the effects of a holistic intervention strategy for women with fear of childbirth during pregnancy. This study will enable the development of new and effective intervention strategies that can be used in prenatal and postnatal care practices and will guide clinical practices to make pregnant women's birth experiences more positive. In this study, the effects of mindfulness-based intervention and haptonomy application on childbirth self-efficacy, prenatal attachment and anxiety levels in pregnant women experiencing fear of childbirth will be evaluated. This research will be conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study. The data of the research will consist of 225 women (75 in the mindfulness group, 75 in the haptonomy group, and 75 in the control group) who applied to the Erzurum City Hospital Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic between 01.06.2024 and 01.07.2025.

Moreover, there is uncertainty about the cardiovascular tolerance of febuxostat taken over the long term. Finally, although XOIs are generally well tolerated, they can cause side effects and require regular biological monitoring.

The study will also investigate how medical students feel about the two training methods and examine how many experience cybersickness. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does self-guided VR simulation work as well as facilitator-guided VR simulation in teaching medical students how to manage critically ill children?
* How do medical students experience the ease of use, workload, reflection on learning, and motivation in each training method?
* How many students experience cybersickness? To answer these questions, researchers will compare the two training methods to evaluate if self-guided VR simulation is an effective way to teach medical students how to manage critically ill children.

Participants will:

NCT06956820,Empowering Patients to Improve Safety in Polymedication,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956820,EmpaSafe,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Rationale: In current clinical practice, polypharmacy and patient empowerment are critical yet often overlooked. Polypharmacy, the chronic use of five or more drugs, poses risks such as adverse drug reactions and decreased medication adherence, especially in elderly and multimorbid patients. Despite the interconnected nature of drug-drug and drug-gene pro inter-actions, they are considered separately. Ignoring these interactions can be hazardous, yet clinical trials to investigate them are infeasible due to fast-growing complexity, variability among patients, high costs associated with large-scale studies, and ethical and logistical chal-lenges. Consequently, there is a substantial knowledge gap in managing complex medication regimens in real-life scenarios and providing guidelines to enhance patient empowerment and drug safety. The SafePolyMed project aims to develop a patient-centred framework to define, assess and manage drug-drug, drug-gene and drug-drug-gene interactions. This framework, a web-based medication management centre, will support patients in managing their therapy-related health data, enhancing education and empowerment, and improving patient safety.

Objective: To assess the impact of the developed medication management centre on patient empowerment in polypharmacy patients, thereby improving drug safety. Secondary objec-tives are to explore if the tool is able to identify patients at risk for a drug-drug-gene interaction and lower the adverse drug event rate.

Study design: The study is a proof of concept study conducted at four institutes located in Germany, Greece, Slovenia and The Netherlands. Polypharmacy patients will use the medi-cation management centre (MMC), which provides curated, patient-specific information about drug interactions and PGx. To assess patient empowerment, patients will receive ques-tionnaires during a 12 week follow-up period.

Study population: 120 subjects with polypharmacy (defined as the chronic use of 5 or more drugs) of at least 18 years of age, with a first prescription for one of 10 index drugs. The study will be performed at 4 different sites (Leiden (NL), Patras (GR), Ljubljana (SL), Aachen (DE)) to represent different clinical settings across Europe. Each site will recruit 30 patients.

Intervention: The MMC that provides patient centred information on drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics affecting personal polytherapy. The MMC will show a selection of high quality publicly available information such as details on different types of medications, includ-ing their uses, side effects and instructions for use, in the language of the patient. This infor-mation is targeted at an individual patient's medication profile to inform patients to better un-derstand and deal with their personal health information, with regard to drug therapy. Patients in the Netherlands, Slovenia and Greece also will receive their PGx profile to further personal-ise the MMC experience.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the sense of empowerment and health literacy for participants before and after use of the MMC. Secondary outcomes include an evaluation of the drug-drug-gene interactions and adverse drug events in the study popula-tions compared to matched historical controls.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit, and group relatedness: Patients are exposed to the regular treatment. In addition, patients will receive questionnaires at baseline, two, and twelve weeks regarding the use and experience of the medication management centre, and a close-out interview at week twelve. In addition, 10ml of blood will be collected during a venipuncture for pharmacogenetic analyses.

Benefits include having access to the medication management centre for the duration of the study. Additionally, patients will receive their PGx profile. This can be used to individualize drug treatment, based on the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guidelines.

Overall, minimal risks are expected for subjects as they will receive normal clinical care. In-formation from the MMC will be a curation of existing publicly available data. Any information regarding DDIs and DGIs will be supplemented with a disclaimer that the patient should not adjust their treatment without talking to a healthcare provider.",NO,Polypharmacy,DEVICE: Medication Management Center,"Change in participants' health literacy score, Health literacy will be assessed using the Health Literacy Survey European Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q47).

NCT06956742,Intermittent Intrapulmonary Deflation and Dyspnea Following Exercise in People With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956742,DEFLA-DYSPNEA,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a long-term lung condition that causes breathing difficulties. People living with this disease often feel short of breath, especially during physical activity, which can make daily tasks more challenging. This breathlessness is partly caused by mucus accumulation within the airways and air getting trapped in the lungs. Both of these reduce the amount of fresh air that can enter with each breath and increase the effort required to breathe.

To manage symptoms, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may use medications, oxygen therapy, or be referred to pulmonary rehabilitation programs. These programs often include exercise training, self-management strategies, and airway clearance techniques. While chest physiotherapists typically guide patients in these techniques, certain medical devices can also help individuals manage their condition independently at home.

One such device uses a method called intermittent intrapulmonary deflation, which involves applying gentle pressure changes through a mouthpiece to help loosen mucus and release trapped air from the lungs. Although some individuals already use this kind of device as part of their daily care, more scientific evidence is needed to determine whether the improvements in airway clearance and reduced air trapping actually lead to measurable relief of breathlessness.

The goal of this clinical trial is to find out whether this type of medical device designed to remove airway mucus and trapped air in the lungs (using intermittent intrapulmonary deflation) can help reduce breathlessness (dyspnea) after physical activity in people with COPD.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Does using the device at home for one week reduce the intensity of breathlessness after walking?
* Does it also improve walking distance, reduce the feeling of muscle fatigue, or increase satisfaction with the airway clearance method?

Researchers will compare the active device to a placebo device that looks and feels identical but does not deliver the active treatment. This comparison will help determine whether the observed effects are due to the device itself or other factors such as expectations or chance.

Participants in this study will be adults diagnosed with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All participants must have recently completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program, continue to experience breathlessness while walking, and show signs of lung hyperinflation (when air remains trapped in the lungs). People will not be included if they have other serious health conditions that could make walking difficult or unsafe, or if they have any contraindications to using the device.

Participants who agree to participante in the study will:

* Attend a visit at the pulmonary rehabilitation center for baseline testing and to learn how to use the device;
* Be randomly assigned to use either the active device or the placebo device at home for 7 days;
* Return to the center for walking tests, lung function tests, and questionnaires about breathing and fatigue;
* After a one-week break, use the device with alternative settings (the one not used in the first phase) for another 7 days;
* Complete a final visit at the end of the study to repeat the same tests.

Participants will also be invited to take part in an ancillary study during their first clinic visit to examine how a single session with the device affects breathlessness immediately after walking.

This research will help determine whether this non-pharmacological, device-based method of clearing mucus and reducing trapped air can bring meaningful improvement in breathlessness for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially when used at home. If effective, it may offer a simple and convenient way to help people breathe more comfortably during everyday activities.

NCT06956677,Usability and Effectiveness of a Novel Bilateral Upper Limb Training Device for Stroke Patients With Hemiparesis: A Preliminary Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956677,Synslai,COMPLETED,"Background and Study Aims Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide, affecting millions of individuals each year. After experiencing a stroke, many patients face challenges with their upper limbs, resulting in difficulties in performing daily activities. This study aims to evaluate a new rehabilitation device designed to assist stroke patients with hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) in improving their upper limb function. The goal is to determine if this device can effectively support recovery while providing an affordable and accessible option for rehabilitation.

Who Can Participate? This study is open to adults aged between 18 and 70 years, regardless of sex. To participate, individuals must have a confirmed diagnosis of hemiplegic stroke, which means they must experience weakness in one side of the body. Participants should have had their stroke within the last 12 months and must be able to follow simple commands. Those with cognitive impairments, other neurological disorders, certain orthopedic conditions affecting the upper limb, or active skin issues will not be eligible.

What Does the Study Involve? Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to two groups: one group will use the new rehabilitation device, while the other will receive conventional occupational therapy. Both groups will undergo an assessment before and after the intervention to measure their improvement in upper limb function. The device encourages exercises that are essential for fostering movement recovery, while the conventional therapy focuses on traditional rehabilitation methods. Participants will have their upper limb function evaluated through established assessment tools to gauge progress.

What Are the Possible Benefits and Risks of Participating? By participating in this study, individuals may experience improvements in their upper limb function, leading to increased independence and enhanced quality of life. Additionally, participants will contribute to valuable research that could improve rehabilitation strategies for future stroke patients. While the rehabilitation device is designed to be safe, some individuals may experience mild discomfort or fatigue from the exercises. However, serious side effects are rare. Participants are encouraged to discuss any concerns with the research team.

Where Is the Study Run From? The study is being conducted at New Taipei Municipal TuCheng Hospital in Taiwan, specifically in the rehabilitation ward, where trained medical professionals oversee the research process.

When Is the Study Starting and How Long Is It Expected to Run For? The study commenced in September 2023 and is expected to continue through November 2024. This timeline allows for recruiting participants and thorough data collection to assess the device's effectiveness.

Who Is Funding the Study? This study does not have external funding and is being conducted independently by the researchers involved. All costs associated with the study, including participant care and device usage, are covered by the resources of the conducting institution.

NCT06956664,Exercise Therapy After Caudal Epidural Steroid Injection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956664,CAPER,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"\*\*Brief Summary\*\*

Lumbar radicular pain arising from intervertebral disc herniation is commonly managed with a caudal epidural steroid injection (CESI), a minimally invasive procedure that delivers anti-inflammatory medication to the sacral hiatus. Although CESI affords short-term analgesia, a sizable proportion of patients continue to experience pain-related disability and diminished quality of life, underscoring the need for optimised post-injection rehabilitation.

This single-centre, three-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial will evaluate the comparative efficacy of two evidence-informed exercise paradigms-moderate-intensity aerobic training and progressive lumbopelvic stabilisation-when each is superimposed upon a standard physiotherapy package of heat, therapeutic ultrasound and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Forty-two adults (18-70 years) with MRI-confirmed lumbar disc herniation who have undergone CESI at Çankırı State Hospital will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to one of the following six-week interventions, initiated two weeks post-injection and delivered thrice weekly under physiotherapist supervision:

1. Conventional physiotherapy alone (heat + ultrasound + TENS).
2. Conventional physiotherapy plus aerobic exercise (treadmill walking at 55-80 % of age-predicted maximal heart rate with structured warm-up/cool-down).
3. Conventional physiotherapy plus core-stabilisation exercise (phased activation of deep trunk musculature progressing to dynamic tasks on unstable surfaces).

Primary end-points are pain intensity (10 cm Visual Analogue Scale) and back-specific disability (Oswestry Disability Index). Secondary end-points include generic health-related quality of life (SF-12) and lumbar proprioceptive body awareness (Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire). Outcomes will be captured at baseline, post-intervention (6 weeks) and at 3- and 6-month follow-up to ascertain both immediate and sustained effects.

Study Question Does adjunctive aerobic or core-stabilisation exercise confer superior reductions in pain and disability, and greater gains in quality of life and body awareness, compared with conventional physiotherapy alone in adults following CESI for lumbar disc herniation?

It is hypothesised that both exercise approaches will yield clinically and statistically superior outcomes relative to standard care, with stabilisation training providing the most durable functional benefits. Findings are expected to refine post-CESI rehabilitation algorithms and inform evidence-based clinical guidance for physiotherapists managing lumbar disc pathology.",NO,Intervertebral Disc Displacement|Low Back Pain|Radiculopathy,OTHER: Conventional Physiotherapy|BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic Exercise Programme|BEHAVIORAL: Core-Stabilization Exercise Programme,"Change in Pain Intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, 0-10), Unit of Measure: points on a 0-to-10 scale Description: 11-point Numeric Rating Scale; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain.

NCT06956534,"Definition, Assessment and Treatment of Spasticity According to Physiotherapists and Occupational Therapists in Flanders, Belgium: A Cross-sectional Qualitative Study.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956534,,COMPLETED,"The definition of spasticity described by Lance in 1980 provided a strong academic foundation for characterizing this neurological symptom. However, there are doubts about its value in clinical practice for evaluating and treating spasticity. This ""upper motor neuron syndrome"" is highly complex and does not exist in isolation. Beyond the various definitions that have been attributed to it, spasticity correlates with sensory input, movement, muscle properties, and the continuity of the central nervous system. This has led to an ongoing academic debate regarding how spasticity should be classified and how it should be treated correctly.

This study aims to improve quality by gaining a better understanding of how healthcare providers (physiotherapists \& occupational therapists) perceive the definition, evaluation, and treatment of spasticity. The questionnaire is based on the existing study by Blanchette et al. (2017), which was conducted in Canada and surveyed both English- and French-speaking physiotherapists and occupational therapists. That study examined sociodemographic data, work environment, satisfaction with measurement tools for spasticity, and treatment preferences. This study adopts these components while adding an extra item: the definition of spasticity. The research team included this item to explore how healthcare providers interpret spasticity. This will be assessed through multiple-choice and open-ended questions.

The research will be conducted under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Steven Truijen (Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium, steven.truijen@uantwerpen.be) and Prof. Dr. Wim Saeys (Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium, wim.saeys@uantwerpen.be), organized by the University of Antwerp.

Oral prednisolone for 28 days is the only treatment which has been proven to improve short-term survival over placebo in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. However, prednisolone alone cannot be regarded as an ideal treatment because some patients still have a bad outcome despite being treated with corticosteroids. Response to treatment can be predicted by the Lille score, a simple tool that is calculated after 7 days of prednisolone course. The ideal binary cut-off of the Lille is 0.45, responders having a Lille score \< 0.45 and non-responders having a Lille score ≥0.45. In terms of treatment management, approximately 30% of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis do not take benefit from prednisolone and are classified as null responders by a Lille score greater than 0.56. In them, there is a consensus for stopping prednisolone after a 7-day course of treatment (Lille score is calculated after 7 days) while patients with a Lille score \<0.56 continue treatment for a total of 30 days.

Numerous trials have attempted to test the impact of other strategies in association with prednisolone, but none of them has shown an improvement in survival (primary endpoint) as compared to prednisolone alone. These strategies include for instance pentoxifylline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and enteral nutrition.

Because oxidative stress is a major driver of liver injury during alcohol-related liver disease, antioxidants, especially N-acetylcysteine, have been tested for many years to treat alcoholic hepatitis. N-acetylcysteine alone does not seem to bring a survival benefit over placebo while it may improve outcome when combined to prednisolone.

Historically in severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment is only given for one month. However, a significant proportion of patients still disclose impaired hepatic function after treatment has been stopped (e.g. 50% of patients still have a MELD score ≥17 after 60 days in). It is thus tempting to hypothesize that a proportion of patients will recover slowly and may take benefit from a prolonged treatment. Such strategy has been proposed in some old studies with relatively limited sample size but never tested with a rigorous approach.

In the present study, for the first time in alcoholic hepatitis, we will take into account the recent recommendations of international experts by choosing an innovative primary endpoint that does not only include mortality and evaluate this endpoint at the preferred timepoint of 90 days.

After more than 30 years of negative trials in severe alcoholic hepatitis, the present study is aimed to evaluate two important new strategies to decrease both mortality and liver impairment.",NO,Alcoholic Hepatitis,DRUG: N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) Treatment|DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Placebo of N-acetylcysteine|DRUG: Placebo of Prednisolone|DRUG: Prednisolone,"Rate of patients alive with compensated liver disease, Rate of patients alive with compensated liver disease defined as a MELD score \<17 at 90 days.

NCT06956443,Prediction of ICG for Skin Necrosis in Mastectomy With Immediate Reconstruction,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956443,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background Breast cancer represents 30 percent of newly diagnosed malignancies in female patients and is the leading cause of death in middle-aged women. Surgical treatment of breast cancer is performed with breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. An increasing proportion of breast cancer patients undergo breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Reconstruction can be performed using various techniques that may involve the use of autologous tissues, implants, or a combination of both. However, mastectomy followed by immediate reconstruction can be associated with complications, including skin and fat necrosis, which occurs in 20% of cases.

When assessing tissue perfusion during immediate reconstruction, the surgeon relies on subjective observations, including skin color, capillary refill, and the occurrence of bleeding. One possible technique to assist the surgeon in assessing tissue perfusion is near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with Indocyanine Green (ICG). ICG can visualize tissue perfusion, because once in the bloodstream it is completely and permanently fixed to plasma proteins and circulates only in the intravascular compartment. ICG was approved for clinical use of tissue perfusion as early as 1956, such as in intestinal anastomoses, for the perfusion of free flaps or parathyroid glands.

ICG can also help predict postoperative skin necrosis in breast reconstruction after mastectomy. In patients undergoing (reconstructive) breast surgery, the intraoperative use of ICG NIR fluorescence imaging has been shown to help surgeons assess skin viability, thereby reducing the occurrence of skin necrosis in several studies. This reduction in necrosis can be explained by the intraoperative removal of tissue with reduced fluorescence intensity, observed with ICG NIR fluorescence imaging. However, there is no consensus on which ICG-NIR perfusion parameter is most accurate for assessing tissue perfusion. Further research is needed to determine cut-off values for adequate tissue perfusion. This study focuses on quantifying perfusion parameters and determining the diagnostic accuracy of ICG-NIR in patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.

What is the purpose of the study/research question? The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive value of quantified ICG fluorescence angiography for the occurrence of skin necrosis in patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with associated cut-off values.

Study design/procedure and intervention:

This will be a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction using ICG-NIR (the use of ICG during these operations is not an additional procedure).

This study will include patients who have undergone surgery with ICG (mastectomy with immediate reconstruction). We will use the videos of the ICG angiography for quantitative analysis of the data. This data will be correlated with the postoperative outcome (occurrence of skin/fat necrosis).

NCT06956079,Effect of End-inspiratory Pause on Gas Exchange During Mediastinal Mass Excision With CO2 Insufflation and One-lung Ventilation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956079,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,""" Mediastinal mass excision is typically performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). To secure a clear surgical field, the ipsilateral lung must be deflated, achieved through one-lung ventilation (OLV) and intrathoracic CO₂ insufflation. However, OLV increases intrapulmonary shunt due to continued perfusion of the non-ventilated lung, potentially leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

When performed in the supine position, gas exchange becomes more challenging compared to lateral decubitus due to limited gravitational redistribution of blood flow. Although CO₂ insufflation aids surgical exposure through passive lung deflation, it may also increase CVP and PCWP, reduce cardiac output, and raise PaCO₂, contributing to respiratory acidosis.

End-inspiratory pause (EIP), a ventilatory setting that pauses airflow at end-inspiration, prolongs alveolar gas exchange and improves ventilation-perfusion matching.

NCT06956053,Personalized Optimization of Antibiotic Therapy in Pulmonary Sepsis Critically Ill Patients Through Application of Rapid Microbiological Diagnostic Technologies and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modelling,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06956053,IDAST,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Severe community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy (AAT) is consistently the most effective intervention for reducing mortality. Cure is most likely when pharmacokinetic (PK) / pharmacodynamics (PD) targets associated with maximum antibiotic (ABX) activity are achieved. However, the process of optimizing antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients remains a complicated challenge.

A key issue is pathogen identification (ID) with subsequent antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) results which allow for selection of AAT. Standard laboratory procedures typically require 2-3 days to provide ID and AST results. Optimal ABX dosing/dosing intervals depend in large part on PK properties in individual patients, and antibacterial effects on the infecting bacteria (PD). Alterations in the primary PK parameters, namely volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (CL), are commonly observed, and are the most influential parameters in determining ABX dosing and exposure. ABX dosing/dosing intervals that do not account for these features are likely to lead to suboptimal ABX exposure and therapeutic failures. Because of 48-72-hours delays in ID/AST, initial treatment is frequently inappropriate in coverage, unnecessarily broad in spectrum, and/or suboptimal in dosing.

Methods for rapid bacterial growth, ID, AST and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) identification were developed and are capable of quantitative ID in 1-2 hours and major AST in 6-8 hours using clinical specimens. Rapid ID of the infecting pathogen and its individual AST could significantly impact the early selection of AAT and, combined with therapeutic drug monitoring data, could be used to calculate optimized dosing regimens that are personalized for the patient in order to achieve appropriate PK/PD targets.

Cardiogenic shock is a well-known and potent trigger of the immune response, ischemia/reperfusion organ damage, hemolysis and release of free hemoglobin. The activation of immune cells leads to the release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, activated complement and others. As a result of myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion injury, a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome may develop.

Screening for colorectal cancer is based on the search for blood in the stool using fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Occult bleeding is an indication for colonoscopy. In a FIT positive population, 60% of colonoscopies are negative, 34% diagnose an adenomatous lesion, and 6% a cancer. The identification of new biological markers could reduce the number of colonoscopies performed. Cancer cells release extracellular vesicles that contain proteins, mRNAs, DNA, which they can transfer to neighbouring or distant cells. The use of exosomal proteins as novel tumor markers looks very promising. We performed a pilot study comparing the levels of different exosomal proteins in 74 subjects which was recently accepted for publication in Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis. Comparison of results showed that only matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) was significantly higher in patients with colorectal cancer or adenoma than in people with normal colonoscopy.

The primary objective of the current study is to determine the best cut-off value of MMP-14 for colorectal cancer screening and to evaluate the performance (Sensitivity, Specificity...) associated to this cut-off value. The secondary objective will be to determine the best cut-off value of MMP-14 for colorectal adenomas screening and to evaluate its performance.

For this purpose, 650 patients, seen for diagnostic colonoscopy following a positive FIT test, will be included in the study. After blood collection and exosome isolation, MMP-14 will be measured using a quantitative test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and the results will be associated with colonoscopy results to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and net present value (NPV).",NO,Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,OTHER: Blood will be drawn from 2 additional tubes of 5 ml each,"Serum Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP14) : normal versus a cancerous lesion, Concentration of Serum Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP14) depending on whether the colonoscopy was normal or revealed a cancerous lesion, At 30 minutes","Serum Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP14) MMP14 Concentration: Normal vs. Adenoma, Concentration of Serum Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP14) depending on whether the colonoscopy was normal or revealed an adenoma, At 30 minutes|Serum MMP14 Concentration according to adenoma characteristics, Concentration of Serum Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP14) according to adenoma characteristics, At 30 minutes|Serum MMP14 Concentration between groups: normal colonoscopy vs. adenoma and cancerous lesions, Comparison of exosomal plasma MMP14 concentration between groups: normal colonoscopy vs. adenoma and cancerous lesions, At 30 minutes|Diagnostic performances of Serum MMP14, Sensitivity and specificity, At 30 minutes|Concentration of markers derived from circulating tumor exosomes in the context of colorectal cancer, Mean value of markers derived from circulating tumor exosomes, At 30 minutes",,CHU de Reims,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,650,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SCREENING,PR25047,2025-05,2027-05,2027-05,2025-05-02,,2025-05-02,"Damien JOLLY, Reims, France",

NCT06955728,A Clinical Trial on Safety in Pregnant Women and How Well the Infant is Protected Against RSV-associated Lower Respiratory Tract Infection When the Pregnant Woman Receives the Approved RSV Vaccine Compared to a Placebo.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955728,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that often affects children during childhood. Even though most cases of RSV are mild, it can cause serious disease and even death - especially in very young babies, babies born too early and those born with heart and lung problems. It is the most common cause for children under 5 years old to be hospitalised. In 2019, there were about 33 million RSV-infections in the lower respiratory tract (in the lungs and below the voice box) of which 3,6 million people were hospitalised and 26,300 passed away in hospital due to RSV. Almost half (50%) of deaths that are caused by RSV, happen in children younger than 6 months old and the majority (more than 95%) of these deaths happen to infants and children in low- and middle-income countries.

A way that can help protect babies from becoming infected is through giving vaccines against the germ (RSV) that is targeted for prevention. There are currently no registered vaccines that can be given directly to babies however there is a lot of information available that shows that a vaccine can be safely giving to a mother while she is still pregnant. The mother then produces antibodies (protection cells) that is transferred to the baby before the baby is born, and the baby is protected from getting sick during the first few months of life.

One of the vaccines that has been developed (ABRYSVO) has been used in many clinical trials in pregnant moms (and older people) to test if it is safe and will protect young babies and much older people who are all at the highest risk for a severe RSV disease. The vaccine was given to more than 4,000 pregnant women. The results from the study and previous studies showed that the vaccine was safe and the babies had a lower chance of getting severe RSV disease and going to hospital. It showed that the vaccine prevented severe RSV infection in around 80% of babies younger than 90 days, and 70% of babies younger than 6 months. Therefore, the vaccine has been licensed in a few countries around the world (including the United States of America and other high-income countries) which means that pregnant women can receive this vaccine during their pregnancy if they wish to (without being on a clinical trial). It has also been licensed in South Africa but is not yet available in the country for pregnant women to receive. The licensure is also underway in other African countries.

However, the results of the previous studies of this vaccine also showed that a slightly higher number of premature babies were born to women who received the vaccine compared to women who did not receive the vaccine. The information received from these studies was however not enough to decide if the earlier births were related to the vaccine or not, and more information is needed - which is one of the main reasons for this study. Importantly, all of the babies who were born earlier were only born a few weeks earlier than expected (around 35 weeks of pregnancy), and all the babies were well and survived. The previous studies on this vaccine happened during the COVID-19 pandemic at which time people were wearing masks and contacting other people less therefore not spreading RSV around as we would normally expect. By doing this study, it will assist the investigators to determine if the vaccine is really as good as it is perceived to be for preventing serious RSV illness in the babies.

This RSV vaccine is a very important medical intervention, and it is as important that the effect that this vaccine will have on pregnant women and on the infants born to mothers who receive the vaccine can be measured. It is especially important in African and lower-middle income countries as the vaccine was not tested as much in people living in Africa compared to others. Therefore, the main reason for doing this trial is to see how much value the vaccine can bring to these countries in terms of protecting young babies and infants where many may get a severe infection and be hospitalised. It will also measure if the vaccine does increase the chances of a baby being born earlier than expected. It will only be carried out in the countries after the vaccine has been approved for use by pregnant women (at the right time) as part of their pregnancy care.",NO,RSV Infections|RSV Immunisation|Preterm Labour,DRUG: Vaccine|OTHER: Placebo,"Evaluate the efficacy of RSVA/B-preF against RSV-A or RSV-B subtype confirmed severe LRTI through to 180 days of age by measuring the first occurrence of RT-PCR confirmed RSV severe LRTI, The presence of LRTI will be confirmed according to case definition.

NCT06955715,Pasteurized Donor Human Milk for HIV-Exposed Infants: A Pilot Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955715,,RECRUITING,"Pasteurized Donor Human Milk (PDHM) is recognized as providing vital immunological and nutritional benefits to vulnerable infants. Although PDHM is widely used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to prevent infections (necrotizing enterocolitis) and improve infant health outcomes, its use for other populations, such as HIV-exposed infants, has been minimal.

Pasteurized donor human milk is included in the 2023 Canadian Paediatric Society clinical consensus as a potential way to provide HIV-exposed infants some of the immunological benefits of human milk in a safe manner, as opposed to exclusive formula feeding (which is currently considered the gold standard for HIV-exposed infants). These new consensus guidelines also include recommendations to support those who wish to breastfeed using a harm reduction approach (e.g., increased viral load monitoring by peds infectious diseases), given the low risk of transmission in those adhering to antiretroviral medications. However, mixed feeding (e.g., breastfeeding and provision of infant formula) is not recommended, due to the potential for micro abrasions in the gastrointestinal epithelium as a result of the protein size in infant formula (which is larger and more abrasive than in human milk), which may increase the risk of HIV transmission if the HIV virus is present in breastmilk. As such, donor milk also presents a possible solution to support those who choose to breastfeed, but who may require a temporary supplement for whatever reason (e.g., nipple cracks, mastitis, etc.), as donor milk is human milk, thus has the same size of proteins and does not pose the same risk as infant formula in damaging the epithelial layer in the gut.

Overall, major obstacles remain that prevent newborns outside of the NICU from regularly having access to donor human milk. These obstacles are illustrated by the high cost of donor milk, which is not covered by government programs, and the lack of information about the clinical benefits (for both those who choose to breastfeed or formula feed), acceptability of caregivers for this feeding option, and feasibility of providing donor human milk outside of a hospital setting.

The investigators aim to determine whether giving PDHM to infants exposed to HIV is a practical possibility and learn from caregivers about any challenges associated with this feeding option.

To this end, a 3-week protocol with a single session per week was created.

In the one hand, the study subject must be a soccer player, regardless of whether male or female, and must not be suffering from any active injury.

All subjects must complete an identical warm-up before beginning the noninvasive intervention using the vibration tool.

The warm-up consists of various joint mobility exercises for the legs, a brief cardio session by pedaling a stationary bicycle, and finally, jumping exercises to properly activate the main muscles of the lower limbs and thus be able to begin the intervention protocol.

In the other hand, the study subjects are divided into two groups: intervention and placebo.

Neither the study subject nor the research team knows who belongs to each group; only the person handling the focal vibration tool will know.

To begin the intervention, three surface electromyography probes are placed on the vastus medialis of the quadriceps, the tibialis anterior, and the internal gastrocnemius, and the subject is asked to perform five countermovement jumps barefoot and without moving their arms to gain momentum.

The subject then pedals at 90-100 rpm on a stationary bicycle while wearing the sensors of the 120 Hz focal vibration tool for 10 minutes.

The intervention group wears headgear to ensure tactile stimulation, while the placebo group does not wear headgear, thus ensuring that there is no tactile stimulation.

After the pedaling period, the electromyography sensors are reapplied to the lower limb in the anatomical areas described above, and the same jumping protocol is followed again.

This intervention is identical for the 3 days of recording.

This noninvasive intervention protocol aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 120 Hz focal vibration tool in recruiting muscle fibers in the targeted muscles through numerical improvements in muscle electrical activity and improved countermovement jump parameters.

Older adults are particularly important as their overall health may decline as they get older. Therefore, exercising is important especially for older adults to improve heart and muscle health and functioning in carrying out tasks of daily living. The overall effects of aging on the body can make people less likely to withstand challenges to the body - this is termed 'resilience'. Although aerobic exercise is not super easy and requires continuity, it is not extremely difficult to get used to. However, we still do not know if some types of aerobic exercise are better for you than others at improving resilience. Therefore, this study will look at cycling vs walking to see if one is better at improving resilience in older adults who are 60-80 years old. You will be trained on either a treadmill or cycle ergometer and these exercise sessions will be done over 5 weeks, 3 days a week. Each session will last 40 minutes, start with warm-up and end with cool-down sessions. Assessments will include heart, lung, muscle, and memory and thinking measurements, all of which will be taken before and after the intervention period. This work will help us to better understand how we can improve exercise prescriptions for older adults to sustain their health and functioning in their daily life.",NO,Older People,OTHER: treadmill exercise|OTHER: cycle ergometer exercise,"The change in vastus lateralis mass, Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and ultrasound will be used for this. Muscle thickness, fascicle length, and pennation angle will be measured on ultrasound. BIA is simple to use, places a minimal burden on individuals, uses lightweight and inexpensive equipment, and, most significantly, provides no radiation risk compared to many other methods. It is also found feasible and reliable for the measurement of muscle mass for adults in clinical settings. Ultrasonography is also a technology that is portable, safe, and clearly distinguishes between muscle and subcutaneous fat tissues as well as a valid and novel tool for muscle mass assessment., at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the week 5 (post-intervention)|The changes of muscle strength with maximum voluntary contraction of knee extension, Maximum voluntary contraction is a standardized technique for assessing muscle strength in healthy older adults. Knee extension strength will be measured with an isometric dynamometer., at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the week 5 (post-intervention)|The change in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) capacity via the Ekblom-bak (EB) test, The EB-test consists of exercise at one standardized, low work rate followed by a higher, individually set work rate. Both work rates are performed for 4 minutes at a cadence of 60rpm on a cycle ergometer. The individual higher work rate is chosen by the researcher according to the participants' gender, age, and training background. The higher work rate aims to reach the Borg rate of perceived exertion (RPE) 12-16. Heart rate is measured during the last minute of each work rate (at 3:15, 3:30, 3:45, and 4:00). Then, VO2max is estimated with a formula., at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the week 5 (post-intervention)|The difference in neuromuscular function via force accuracy task, Force accuracy is an important parameter since most daily activities are conducted at submaximal levels, where force fluctuation can be observed and reduce the ability to create an intended movement. Force accuracy will be measured on OTBiolab+ application., at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the week 5 (post-intervention)|The changes in functional ability via the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), The TUG is a tool for assessing lower limb functional ability and its use has been recommended by the literature.

Heart attacks caused by SCAD are different to the traditional heart attacks. In SCAD a tear happens within the blood vessels causing partial or full blockage. The population affected by SCAD is hugely different to the population affected by other 'traditional' heart attacks; as SCAD mainly happens in otherwise healthy women. From historical cases, SCAD has been associated with strenuous exercise, however, medical research did not find a link.

We want to know if this pathway works, is it acceptable to people with diabetes and what the changes might mean in terms of the outcomes for patients and NHS resources and cost?

Screening by Diabetic Eye Service Wales currently involves taking and as-sessing 2-D (dimensional) digital photographs of the back of the eye (reti-na). Leakage from damaged blood vessels can cause swelling within the central part of the retina, known as maculopathy. This swelling cannot be seen on traditional 2-D images.

Diagnosing maculopathy requires a 3-D camera and a technique known as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT is not part of routine screening but, is available in the Hospital Eye Service (HES) and many optician prac-tices. If any changes are seen in the macular region of the retina on 2-D images, the patient will require an OCT scan to see if there is any in-creased thickness. Many patients do not have increased thickness and not everyone with diabetic retinopathy has maculopathy.

Currently after screening, patients who have macular changes that suggest possible maculopathy are referred to the HES for OCT imaging. Many of these patients will not have increased thickness and the appointment could have been better used to see a different patient with increased thickness that requires treatment.

The new pathway that will be investigated in this study involves trained opticians in practices that have an OCT camera taking the required 3-D images and carrying out the initial examination. The images and patient record will then be reviewed by an ophthalmologist working virtually, to decide the management plan. If this pathway is safe and acceptable to people with diabetes, it would reduce the pressure on HES clinics.

NCT06955559,Magnesium Sulfate in Bronchial Asthma and Acute Bronchiolitis in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955559,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Asthma is a prevalent disease that affects as many as334 million individuals worldwide, and is a major source of disability and premature death in children(1).

Asthma affects 7.1 million children in the United States (2). and is the most common pediatric chronic disease(3).Globally, the prevalence of pediatric asthma varies from 10% to 30%. Its symptoms range from chronic cough to life-threatening bronchospasm.(4,5,6).The most common triggers of asthma exacerbations in both younger and older children are viral respiratory tract infections, exposure to allergens, tobacco smoke, air pollutants, cold or dry air, and poorly controlled asthma(4,7).Current management strategies for acute asthma recommend a stepwise approach, with first-line standard therapy followed by additional therapeutic options(8).Firstline therapy consists of inhaled rapid-acting selective b2-agonists, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral or intravenous corticosteroids. Response to standard acute asthma therapy is variable, influenced by factors that cannot be assessed or accounted for urgently such as genetic polymorphisms(9-12).For patients who do not respond adequately to first-line therapy, further improvement can be seen with additional therapy such as inhaled magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) or intravenous aminophylline, terbutaline, or magnesium sulfate. Though all available second-line therapeutic agents produce bronchodilatory effects, magnesium sulfate produces fewer side effects, is more widely available, and costs less than other second-line therapies(13). This combination of efficacy, few side effects, wide availability, and low cost suggest that magnesium sulphate is a promising therapeutic agent that deserves further consideration for use in children with acute asthma. Acute bronchiolitis (AB) is an infection of the lower respiratory tract that is caused by viral agents, especially respiratory syncytial virus, most prevalent in children aged less than 24months(14). It is the most common reason for hospital admissions in the first year of life, representing a significant health burden worldwide. Bronchiolitis usually demonstrates a benign course, most patients are treated as outpatients but progression to severe illness may occur rapidly and respiratory support and admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) may be required promptly in some cases(14). It is characterized by damage of epithelial cells leading to ciliary destruction, airway inflammation, edema, and increased mucus production. Mucus plugs and cellular debris obstruct bronchiolar lumens and result in various degrees of respiratory distress(15). Current recommendations for treatment of AB focus on supportive care, including respiratory support, oxygen supplementation if needed, and adequate hydration. Other treatment agents, such as bronchodilators, hypertonic saline, corticosteroids, and antiviral/antibacterial agents, showed no clearly defined benefit.

To address the dual care needs for PwMCI and hearing impairment, it may be possible to integrate auditory training into cognitive training, as both of them are activity-based and focus on increasing the attention and working memory of an individual to engage in the auditory communication process. Moreover, auditory instruction is one of the core mediums in delivering cognitive training activities. It is highly possible to integrate the auditory training curricular to the corresponding administration process. To tackle the enhanced support need of individuals with dual functional impairment to engage in an integrated training protocol, strategies including a goal-oriented approach and peer support can be integrated to optimize the empowerment network.

NCT06955442,Racial Disparities in Acute Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955442,ERDAS,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. Although the prevalence of stroke is high globally, not all ethnic and racial groups are affected in the same way, leading to the classification of stroke as an inequitable disease.

First of all, ethnic and racial background influences the pathogenesis of stroke, as numerous risk factors-both modifiable and non-modifiable-are more prevalent in Black and Hispanic populations compared to Asian ones. As a direct consequence, the incidence of stroke is higher in Black and Hispanic individuals than in White individuals. Unfortunately, despite this, access to revascularization treatments is not always guaranteed for ethnic and racial minorities, although in recent years, this inequality in access to care appears to be decreasing.

Moreover, stroke prognosis also seems to differ based on race/ethnicity, with mortality being higher among Black individuals compared to White individuals, although this trend tends to decrease with advancing age. On the other hand, although cerebral hemorrhage is more prevalent in Black and Asian populations than in White populations, it tends to have a better prognosis in these minority groups.

It must be considered, however, that the vast majority of studies on this topic have been conducted in the United States, where the ethnic and racial composition of the population is very different from that of Italy and Europe. In these latter contexts, studies investigating the impact of race and/or ethnicity on the clinical characteristics, management, and prognosis of ischemic stroke are lacking. Furthermore, differences in healthcare system organization may play a significant role in limiting access to timely and appropriate medical care for acute stroke based on race and/or ethnicity.

Italy is a country where, similarly to other European nations, the last few decades have seen a significant increase in immigration rates, particularly from Eastern Europe. Today, foreigners account for approximately 9% of the total population. Nevertheless, in Italy, systemic racism toward ethnic and racial minorities remains a significant issue, as evidenced by large disparities in educational attainment, socioeconomic status, and housing conditions between Italian citizens and foreign residents.

Although the universal national healthcare system in Italy should ensure equal access to care and emergency treatment for all, regardless of ethnic and racial background, there are no studies investigating this topic. A recent scoping review highlighted how individual racism plays a primary role in generating health inequalities, whereas there is very limited evidence focused on the analysis of structural and institutional racism in the Italian and European context.

NCT06955377,Effect of Trunk Flexion on Airway Defense in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955377,,RECRUITING,"The main mechanisms of airway protection include a properly functioning swallowing process and a cough. Studies focusing on patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have previously demonstrated impairments in both swallowing (dysphagia) and coughing (dystussia). Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in individuals with PD.

Swallowing function is directly related to body posture. Postural abnormalities (PA) are a common symptom of PD and significantly contribute to patient disability, affect respiratory function, and reduce quality of life. Previous research has shown that more than 20% of PD patients suffer from some form of PA.

Most PD patients with a forward trunk flexion angle greater than 30 degrees report specific difficulties, such as dysphagia. A link has previously been demonstrated between postural abnormalities associated with flexed posture and restrictive ventilatory impairment. It can be assumed that this restrictive ventilatory impairment, which reduces the amount of air the patient can inhale into the lungs and subsequently exhale, negatively affects the strength of voluntary cough. However, this hypothesis has not yet been verified in the mentioned patient group.

Mucositis is one of the leading chemotherapy-related complications affecting the quality of life of the child. Although it varies according to the degree of mucositis, oral mucosal erythema, white plaques and ulcers are extremely painful and traumatising procedures for pediatric patients during mucositis care. The pain and fear they experience during the procedure may lead children to delay/not perform oral mucositis care or not allow their parents to do so. Since mucositis is a painful condition in children, it is recommended to use distracting nonpharmacological methods that can help reduce the pain and fear of children during mucositis care.

NCT06955312,The Effect of Paint-by-Numbers Activity on Stress and Prenatal Attachment in High-Risk Pregnancies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955312,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Pregnancy, a physiological state, is defined both as a turning point and a developmental crisis . Pregnancy directly affects maternal and child health, and in cases of complications, it can lead to morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries . According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 830 women worldwide die daily due to preventable pregnancy- and childbirth-related causes, with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in developing countries, including Turkey (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality).

In Turkey, the 2005 National Maternal Mortality Study reported a maternal mortality rate of 28.5 per 100,000 live births. This study revealed that 49.3% of pregnancy-related deaths and 61.6% of maternal deaths were due to preventable causes Hemorrhage, infection, and preeclampsia/eclampsia are among the leading causes of maternal mortality both in Turkey and globally . This significant issue is included in the Sustainable Development Goals (2016-2030) as a target to reduce global maternal mortality

High-risk pregnancy refers to conditions where maternal, fetal, or neonatal health is partially or entirely at risk . According to the 2013 Turkey Demographic and Health Survey (TNSA), 63% of pregnant women aged 18-34 in Turkey fall into at least one risk category. High-risk pregnancies are associated with various physiological and psychological challenges, negatively impacting maternal, infant, and family health . In addition to posing life-threatening risks, high-risk pregnancies represent a crisis related to fertility . When a pregnancy is high-risk, emotional distress increases due to maternal or fetal complications . Compared to low-risk pregnancies, high-risk pregnant women experience significantly higher stress regarding their own and their baby's health .

Stressors experienced by high-risk pregnant women include receiving a high-risk pregnancy diagnosis, unplanned pregnancy, pregnancy complications, fetal abnormalities, childbirth fears, adolescent pregnancies, marital issues, lack of social support, economic concerns, postpartum problems, and hospitalization . Perceived stress during pregnancy is highly significant for pregnancy outcomes . Pregnancy-related stress has been characterized as a stronger form of stress than general stress due to its ability to trigger heightened physiological arousal . This can have adverse effects, increasing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality risks . Stress may elevate oxytocin and prostaglandin hormone levels while reducing beta-endorphin and progesterone levels, leading to birth complications or adverse birth outcomes .

Stress during pregnancy has been associated with negative birth outcomes, including preterm labor, spontaneous abortion, neonatal malformations, and growth retardation . Additionally, stress can negatively impact parental attachment to the fetus and newborn . There is a bidirectional relationship between attachment and a woman's psychosocial well-being. Prenatal attachment is influenced by the mother's psychosocial state, and a lack of attachment can negatively affect her mental well-being. Literature suggests a link between prenatal attachment and long-term maternal depression . A study highlighting the potential adverse effects of stress on prenatal attachment in high-risk pregnancies emphasized the importance of supporting prenatal attachment to prevent postpartum issues such as anxiety and depression .",NO,High-Risk Pregnancies,BEHAVIORAL: Experimental,"Perceived Stress Level, Measured using a validated stress scale (Perceived Stress Scale in High-Risk Pregnancies Based on the Neuman Systems Model (NSM-HRPS).

While the sum of the scores in the sub-dimensions in NSMt-RGASÖ constitutes the stress score in that life area, the sum of the scores of all the items constitutes the total scale score.

By using pressure tablets and other devices, the front, back, left, and right positions of the center of gravity can be measured, reflecting the body's balance state under static conditions. Under normal circumstances, the center of gravity is relatively stable and within the range of the area supported by both feet., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.|Center of gravity swing amplitude, It refers to the maximum distance that the center of gravity deviates from the center position within a certain period of time. The smaller the swing amplitude, the better the static balance ability. Generally measured in millimeters (mm), when healthy adults stand quietly, the amplitude of their center of gravity swing back and forth is usually around 10-20mm, and the amplitude of left and right swing is relatively small., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.|Center of gravity swing frequency, It refers to the number of times the center of gravity swings per unit time. The lower the frequency, the stronger the static balance control capability. When a normal adult stands quietly, the frequency of center of gravity swing is generally between 0.5-2 times per second., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.|Walking stability, It is evaluated by analyzing the step characteristics during walking, including step length, stride length, step frequency, bipedal support time, single foot support time, and other parameters. For example, if the stride is uniform, the stride is stable, the stride frequency is moderate, and the ratio of foot support time to single foot support time is reasonable, it indicates good dynamic balance ability during walking. When adults walk normally, the stride length is about 50-80cm, and the step frequency is around 90-120 steps per minute., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.|Posture transition ability, It measures the stability and coordination during the transition from one posture to another (such as sitting to standing, standing to walking, etc.). The evaluation indicators include conversion time, accuracy of center of gravity shift, and whether additional support or auxiliary movements are needed. Healthy individuals complete posture transitions quickly and smoothly, with a smooth shift of center of gravity, typically without the need for external force or excessive adjustment movements., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.|Disturbance response ability, The ability of the human body to restore balance through its own balance adjustment mechanism when subjected to external disturbances such as sudden thrust, tension, or ground shaking. The relevant parameters include reaction time, maximum offset distance, and time to restore balance. Rapid response, ability to control the body's center of gravity within a small deviation range and quickly restore balance, indicate good disturbance response ability., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.|Visual dependence level, It is evaluated by comparing the balance test results between open and closed eye states. If the balance function significantly decreases after closing the eyes, it indicates a high degree of dependence on visual information; On the contrary, if there is not much difference in balance performance between opening and closing the eyes, it indicates that other balance regulation mechanisms such as proprioception have played a good role. For example, in the test of standing on one foot with closed eyes, the ability to stand for a longer period of time when the eyes are open is significantly reduced, indicating that vision plays an important role in maintaining balance in this posture., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.|Muscle activity pattern, Using techniques such as surface electromyography to record the activation sequence, intensity, and duration of different muscles during balance tasks. Normal balance control requires multiple groups of muscles to work together, and whether the muscle activity pattern is normal or not can reflect the nervous system's ability to control muscles and the coordination and cooperation between muscles. For example, when maintaining balance in a standing position, the calf muscles, hip muscles, and back muscles will contract and relax in a timely manner according to changes in the body's center of gravity to maintain stability., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks.","anxiety, Beck Anxiety Inventory Scoring is based on the severity of anxiety symptoms, and the total score is calculated by adding up each result. Scores 15-25 indicate mild anxiety, 26-35 indicate moderate anxiety, and scores above 36 indicate severe anxiety., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks|sleep quality, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) According to the various indicators of sleep quality, the frequency is divided into 0-5 points: good sleep quality, 6-10 points: decent sleep quality, 11-15 points: average sleep quality, 16-21 points: poor sleep quality., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks|Self efficacy, ABC Balanced Confidence Scale Based on the confidence level of each item, ranging from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (completely confident), the total score is taken as the average of all items.

In general, badminton jumping actions have two goals: achieve maximum height and reach a precise location using certain body movements. Both objectives are important in badminton and must be considered when conducting practical training sessions and imparting techniques. The players should have agility to move on the court forward sideward and backward to do many actions with high speed. They require sports specific training to achieve power, stability and agility in the ground for a powerful performance. Contrast strength training is multi-intervention programs and it has a certain influence on agility, power and speed.A sample size of 48 badminton players from Pakistan Sports Board, university level and badminton club players will be taken through Non-Probability Convenience Sampling technique.

NCT06955026,Effect of the Hockey Slideboard Training Combined With Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) in the Rehabilitation Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgical Reconstruction (ACL-R),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955026,,RECRUITING,"ACL injuries represent a major health and economic burden. The overall incidence of ACL injuries has increased and is likely to continue to increase, in part due to increased sports participation.

In the acute post-surgical phase there is a period of physiologic recovery from the surgical injury and subsequent relative muscle disuse that is associated with atrophy loss of strength and anterior knee pain. Therefore, improvement of muscle function is a priority in the rehabilitation and reathletization process.

To achieve significant muscle hypertrophy as well as a possible subsequent increase in strength, it is widely accepted that resistance exercises with relevant load (\~70% of the one repetition maximum - 1RM) are necessary; however, in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R), exercises with high loads are considered unsafe in the early stages and could increase the risk of re-injury.

BFR training is an established muscle training and rehabilitation technique in which the blood supply to and from the muscles involved in the exercise is restricted using an external device.

Although the physiological mechanisms related to this intervention are not yet well understood, it is thought that in BFR training, despite the low level of mechanical tension, the main driver of myocellular hypertrophy could be metabolic stress that is realized by local accumulation of metabolites. Thus, it seems that hypertrophic adaptations can be induced with much lower exercise intensities using BFR. In fact, when combined with low-load resistance training (e.g., 20% 1RM), training with BFR has shown positive results in increasing muscle volume and strength after ACL-R in complete safety comparable to standard training without BFR.

It has also already been demonstrated how incorporating the use of the hockey slideboard into the rehabilitation procedure following ACL-R gives benefits in terms of strength recovery of the extensor muscles of the operated limb with the same safety profiles as standard rehabilitation.",NO,Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture|Rehabilitation After ACL Reconstruction,OTHER: Hockey slideboard combined with BFR training|OTHER: Hockey slideboard,"Adductor muscles maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), Adductor muscles' maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) measured via hand-held dynamometer test in a supine position, Before the study intervention (T0) and after the study intervention lasting for four weeks (T1)","Abductor muscles maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), Abductor muscles' maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) measured via hand-held dynamometer test in a supine position, Before the study intervention (T0) and after the study intervention lasting for four weeks (T1)|Adductor/abductor isometric strength (MVIC) ratio, Adductor and abductor muscles' maximal voluntary isometric (MVIC) strength ratio measured via hand-held dynamometer test in a supine position, Before the study intervention (T0) and after the study intervention lasting for four weeks (T1)|Y-balance test (YBT) composite score, The YBT assessment demands that the athlete maintain balance on one leg while extending the opposite leg as far as feasible in three different directions: anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial.

NCT06955013,Ultrasound to View Abdominal Wall Muscle Layers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955013,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) views ultrasound guided nerve blocks to be a core skill for emergency medicine physicians. (ACEP 2021) They are used widely, commonly for various traumatic injuries, both for repair/stabilization of injuries, as well as for pain control while awaiting definitive management. Ultrasound is often used to identify specific nerves or fascial planes to guide deposition of local anesthetic. Some of these blocks include interscalene brachial plexus blocks to help manage shoulder dislocation, supraclavicular brachial plexus nerve blocks to help manage elbow dislocation or distal wrist fracture reductions, fascia iliaca plane block for pain control of hip fractures patients awaiting definitive surgery, and serratus anterior plane block to help manage rib fracture pain. (Martin 2024) As these techniques become more mainstream due to increasing focus upon them in residency training and improvements in ultrasound technology research upon these blocks has increased dramatically since 2016, with most of these articles focusing on hip fracture and shoulder dislocation. (Tsai 2022) The abdominal musculature of the flank is comprised of the external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, and the transversus abdominis. Branches of the lateral cutaneous nerve pass between the internal oblique muscle innervating the peritoneum. First described in the anesthesia literature in 2001, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been found to decrease narcotic requirement after abdominal surgery by targeting these branches. (Johns 2012) It has also been found to effective when performed by surgeons. (Prabhakar 2023) However it has been only minimally alluded to in the emergency medicine literature (Tsai 2022).

Obesity can have a negative effect on image procurement in ultrasound. Given how little TAP blocks have been reviewed in the EM literature even less is known about emergency physicians' ability to deal with added difficulties brought by increases in body habitus. Some anesthesia teachers recommend out-of-plane needle approaches in obese patients rather than in-plane needle approaches for less challenging body habituses. (Nysora 2022). Ultrasound-guided TAP blocks have been used successfully in bariatric surgery so there is precedent for use in this population (Baumgarter 2024).

Our study proposes to evaluate emergency medicine physician ability to obtain images suitable for potential TAP block administration in patients with varying body habitus. Our hypothesis is that while potential TAP block could be limited by increased body habitus that the majority of patients would still be able to potentially undergo the procedure.

Methods Approval for this study will be sought from the Lakeland IRB. This is a prospective study conducted at an academic community ED with a volume of about 69,000 annually.

Patients were approached by emergency medicine residents on their ultrasound rotation with regards to willingness to participate in the study and written informed consent was obtained.

Inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18 and over who were willing to undergo the informal ultrasound looking to identify the muscular layers with enough definition that a TAP block could be carried out. No injection of medication was carried out in this study. Exclusion criteria included pediatric patients, patients unable to sign consent for themselves (including non-English speakers, patients with dementia or altered mental status), as well as populations potentially at risk (such as pregnant patients, prisoners, and minors). Patients with infectious considerations were excluded (such as those under isolation precautions or with open wounds/skin injury in the abdominal/flank area).

If patients were willing to participate residents assigned patients a study number and recorded basic demographic information (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and Body Mass Index (BMI)). Residents then carried out the ultrasound starting with the linear array probe at the level of the umbilicus, fanning laterally to identify the rectus sheath and then the shared aponeurosis for the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscle. The resulting image of the abdominal wall was then recorded, saved under the patient's study identification number and saved digitally to the study folder maintained on hospital servers. Patients were only enrolled once.

It is considered a standard instrument for evaluating HRQOL and was created by Ware and Sherbourne in the United States.

The 36 items on the questionnaire are broken down into eight domains. The ability to carry out daily tasks including walking, taking care of oneself, and relaxing is assessed by the Physical Functioning (PF) domain, which comprises items 3 through 11.

The majority of the 19 items on the PSQI are answered on a Likert scale. Component scores, which range from 0 to 3, are produced by combining these items. A score of ""0"" indicates no sleep issues at all and score of ""3"" denotes serious sleep issues.

For instance, the daytime dysfunction score is calculated from two items: the frequency of medication use for sleep and the frequency of trouble staying awake during daily activities such as driving or eating. These items are coded on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no issues, 1-2 = mild issues, 3-4 = moderate issues, 5-6 = severe issues).

The questions include statements like ""my fatigue is very debilitating"" and ""exercise brings on my fatigue."" For every item, a higher score denotes a higher level of fatigue. All patients who responded to at least half of the FSS items had their scores determined using the conventional scoring procedure for the FSS, which involves averaging the nine items to provide an overall score that ranges from 1 (no fatigue) to 7 (very severe fatigue).

This test was employed in this study to measure the patients' functional capacity. The 6MWT is a straightforward and practical test that only requires a 100-foot hallway, with no specialized exercise equipment or advanced training for the administering technicians. Since walking is a common activity for nearly all patients, except those with severe impairments, the test measures the maximum distance a patient can walk in six minutes on a flat, hard surface. It evaluates the combined responses of various systems involved in exercise, including the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and peripheral circulatory systems, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism.

A considerable decrease in breathing lasting at least 10 seconds is known as a hypopnea, while a total stop or cessation of breathing lasting at least 10 seconds is known as an apnoea. When combined, apnea and hypopnea cause mini-awakenings and oxygen level dips that interfere with sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea per hour is a measure of the severity of sleep apnea. It is classified as normal (0-5 events/hour), mild (5-15 events/hour), moderate (15-30 events/hour), and severe (\> 30 events/hour) by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).

NCT06954922,The Effect of Memory-Based Exercise and Planned Training Applied to Epilepsy Patients on Quality of Life,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954922,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Epilepsy; It is a chronic, neurological disease that can occur regardless of social class, race and age. Every year, approximately 5 million people worldwide are diagnosed with epilepsy and 50 million people are affected by this disease, constituting a significant part of the disease burden in the world. When we look at the rate of patients in the population who actively experience symptoms of the disease and need treatment, this rate is approximately 4 to 10 people per 1000 people. According to estimates, 700,000 people in Turkey are actively diagnosed with epilepsy. It is accepted that this disease occurs as a result of sudden, abnormal discharge of neurons in some parts of the central nervous system, and the disease generally progresses with recurrent changes in consciousness. The symptoms accompanying epilepsy are perceived negatively by patients and significantly affect their lives. Epilepsy treatment; It consists of several options such as medical drugs, ketogenic diet and surgical intervention. The ultimate goal of treatment is to achieve seizure control, reduce the frequency of seizures, minimize drug side effects that may occur due to long-term treatment, and improve the patient's quality of life. Along with pharmacological treatment, non-pharmacological treatment is also a valuable approach in the treatment of epilepsy. One of the non-pharmacological approaches is rehabilitation interventions with mind and memory exercises. Epilepsy is a disease that requires a complex psychological adaptation for the patient and affects the whole family. In this disease, it is very important for the patient to comply with the treatment requirements, to have self-control over his/her behavior, as well as to cope with the difficulties of living with epilepsy. Increasing the quality of life and preventing possible behavioral problems is possible by keeping mental functions at an optimal level on the one hand, and providing psychological counseling to the patient and his family on the other. Nowadays, epileptic seizures are often more easily controlled with developing pharmacological treatment options. Therefore, the fight against epilepsy should be expanded to include other educational, mental, psychotherapeutic and behavioral interventions besides drug therapy. In a study conducted by the National Center for Health and Care Research (NIHR), electrical activity scans in the brain of 25 epilepsy patients were examined. Some images in different categories were presented to epilepsy patients for a certain period of time. Later, when asked to remember the images shown in the previous step, it was noted that slow waves occurred in the brain during sleep. As a result of the research, it was revealed that the effect of epileptic spikes on brain activity decreased with the emergence of slow waves. This study has demonstrated for the first time a potential protective mechanism used by the brain to counteract epileptic activity. Patients diagnosed with epilepsy who are admitted to the neurology outpatient clinic or admitted to the neurology clinic will be introduced and informed about the study. Patients who want to participate in the study and meet the inclusion criteria will be determined. After patient consent is obtained, groups will be determined according to the randomization list.

NCT06954857,The Influence of Standardized Process Management of Laryngeal Mask Airway Placement Based on Pressure Monitoring on the Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Elderly Patients During the Perioperative Period,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954857,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic ventilation device designed according to human anatomy. It was developed in 1981 by Dr. Archie Boubrain in the United Kingdom to compensate for the deficiencies of tracheal intubation and mask ventilation. It has been widely used in clinical practice because of its simple operation, small airway stimulation, and hemodynamic stability. In 1990, LMA entered the Chinese market. In 1993, LMA was included in the American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines for the emergency management of the difficult airway. In the past, tracheal intubation was the standard method of airway control during general anesthesia. In the past decade, the proportion of LMA ventilated general anesthesia has increased significantly in China and European and American countries. By 2022, the utilization rate of LMA in China climbed to 95.96%. With the continuous improvement and development of LMA, it can be used to establish safe airway management in special positions such as lateral position and prone position, long-term surgery and special site surgery.

However, the wide application has also exposed some key problems. The lack of standardized process management of LMA placement may lead to improper placement, airway obstruction, laryngspasm, reflux, and aspiration during the application of LMA, which may cause a series of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Studies have shown that many adverse events during LMA implantation may be related to LMA pressure monitoring. Inadequate pressure monitoring may lead to pressure imbalance, and improper pressure management may lead to poor coordination between LMA and pharynx. Coupled with the change in intraoperative position and postoperative transfer, the risk of postoperative sore throat and LMA displacement increases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for standardized process management, dynamic pressure monitoring and position adjustment during the use of LMA. The standardized management of LMA insertion involves the standardized selection, placement, maintenance management and transportation of LMA. Especially for the elderly population, LMA displacement is more likely to occur due to the atrophy of pharyngeal mucosa and muscle, weakened cough reflex, and decreased chest wall compliance, which increases the incidence of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. For elderly patients with atherosclerosis, LMA displacement and relatively high cuff pressure may compress the jugular and jugular veins in the neck and surrounding tissues, increasing the risk of stroke in elderly patients. Effective and safe anesthesia airway and respiratory management strategies during general anesthesia will directly affect the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and the incidence of sore throat in elderly patients. Standardized management of LMA and continuous pressure monitoring and adjustment can improve the above adverse reactions.

At present, there is a lack of large-scale and reliable evidence-based medical evidence to evaluate the effect of standardized process management of laryngeal mask insertion based on pressure monitoring on perioperative adverse reactions in elderly patients with high risk of pulmonary complications. Especially in the elderly population with a high incidence of PPCs, the safety, short - and long-term advantages and disadvantages of widespread use of LMA ventilation are still unclear. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to carry out the effect of standardized process management of laryngeal mask insertion based on pressure monitoring on perioperative adverse reactions in elderly patients, and to further explore the appropriate range of laryngeal mask related pressure indicators. This study based on the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) can not only fill the current research gap, but also provide strong support for safe and efficient airway management in elderly patients during the perioperative period, and effectively promote the further optimization of clinical practice, which has extremely important clinical significance and practical value.",NO,LMA|Pressure Injury|Elderly|Airway Management,DEVICE: Cuff pressure monitor,"The incidence of sore throat, VAS scale was used to evaluate the scores.

NCT06954831,Ultra-hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation With Lumpectomy Cavity Boost for the Treatment of Stage I-III Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954831,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This clinical trial tests how well ultra-hypofractionated (UF) whole breast irradiation (WBI) with lumpectomy cavity boost (CB) works in treating patients with stage I-III breast cancer. Breast conservation therapy (BCT) is the recommended treatment for patients with early stage breast cancer. BCT involves a lumpectomy followed by breast radiation. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Traditionally, WBI has been given once daily over 5-6 weeks and then those at high-risk for recurrence receive additional radiation (boost) to the lumpectomy cavity daily over 4-8 days. This has now been replaced by moderate hypofractionated radiation. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Although moderate hypofractionated radiation therapy reduces the length of treatment from 6-7 weeks to 3-4 weeks, the length of treatment still remains a barrier for many patients. UF-WBI with CB delivers radiation to the whole breast and the surgical cavity at the same time over 5 daily treatments.

It will impact about half of Canadian women over their lifetime. With POP, organs like the bladder, uterus, and bowel may push into the vagina. Women may experience urine leakage, physical discomfort, and embarrassment. Aside from surgery, a common treatment for POP is the use of pessaries. Pessaries are removable devices placed inside the vagina that can relieve POP symptoms. Unfortunately, pessaries have fixed sizes and three in ten patients cannot find the right fit. Pessaries can cause bleeding and discomfort if they do not fit well or are not removed and cleaned regularly. Almost half of patients who wear pessaries stop using them because of these issues. There is a need for a better pessary treatment for patients.

The investigators have developed a new pessary that has the natural shape of the vagina. This pessary is easier to remove and re-insert. The pessary is also custom fit for each patient. In this study, the investigators will compare our new pessary to traditional pessaries. Study participants who have been fit with a traditional pessary will be asked to use our new pessary design for 3 months. Study participants will fill out questionnaires about their POP symptoms.

NCT06954688,The Influence of Dry Needling for Hypertonia and Spasticity Treatment on Neuropathic Pain in Lower Extremity of Spinal Cord Injury: A Case Series Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954688,,TERMINATED,"Spinal cord injury is a life-changing event that places a burden on the healthcare system, including caregivers and affected individuals. Studies do not provide a conclusive incidence rate due to methodological differences. However, a trend observed in recent years is an increasing incidence among the elderly population due to falls or non-traumatic spinal cord injury.

The clinical consequences of spinal cord injury include pain and spasticity, in addition to loss of function and activity. On average, 69% of spinal cord injury patients report pain, with one-third experiencing severe pain. A similar prevalence is seen for spasticity, which is often underreported among spinal cord injury patients. Unlike pain, spasticity is considered a common symptom in chronic spinal cord injury, with at least 35% of the SCI population suffering from this sensorimotor control disorder. These two symptoms suggest a correlation, yet clear evidence is lacking.

The secondary aim of this study is to explain the mechanisms of action of Dry Needling at various levels to better determine which subgroup of spinal cord injury patients would benefit most. A targeted study could optimize the effects of such a treatment: a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help with patient stratification and promote a more individualized approach, taking into account the pathogenesis of spasticity and the different mechanisms that can effectively modulate it.

Additionally, this study examines the effect of the dry needling technique on hypertonia and spasticity in the spastic calf muscles of spinal cord injury patients. Research has already shown that this technique has acute effects on hypertonia and spasticity in stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. However, reliable research on spinal cord injury is lacking-currently, only a case report has investigated these effects. Therefore, this study is well-suited to build upon that case report and provide more evidence.

Furthermore, this study serves as a prospective study to observe the correlation between neuropathic pain and spasticity over time. As a pilot study, it has established a collaboration with the REVARTE rehabilitation hospital, which has a large spinal cord injury population.

The research will be conducted under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Steven Truijen (Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium, steven.truijen@uantwerpen.be) and Prof. Dr. Wim Saeys (Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium, wim.saeys@uantwerpen.be), organized from the University of Antwerp.

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with adjuvant whole-breast irradiation (WBI) is currently the standard of care in the oncological treatment of primary breast cancer and offers an equivalent alternative to mastectomy.

However, nodal-negative women have a 10-year risk for local recurrences after RT in up to 15.6%.

NCT06954610,Cardiac Assessment for Recurrent Stroke Risk Evaluation in Atrial Fibrillation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954610,CARE-AF,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting up to 10% of the elderly. Ischemic stroke is the main complication of AF and cardioembolism is one of the leading causes of ischemic stroke, accounting for approximately one third of cases. Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC) is a cornerstone in stroke prevention in patients with AF. According to randomized controlled trials of direct oral anticoagulants, a residual risk of ischemic stroke of 1-2% per year for so-called ""breakthrough stroke"" remains, despite adequate intake of OAC. The majority (\>70%) of these breakthrough strokes are cardioembolic in nature and only a minority are related to medication issues (e.g. non-compliance) or other, non-AF related etiologies. Stroke recurrence risk after such a breakthrough stroke markedly increases to 8-9% per year indicating a particularly high-risk situation. Why OAC fails in certain patients, but not in others remains as poorly understood, as does the reason why the subsequent risk of stroke is so high.

Current risk stratification tools, such as the widely used CHA2DS2-VA(Sc)-score, fail to predict stroke risk in such a high-risk cohort, as they were intended to guide the initiation of OAC in low to moderate risk patients. In light of new therapeutic strategies currently being investigated, such as percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with breakthrough strokes (ELAPSE - NCT05976685) or in AF-patients deemed high-risk (LAAOS IV - NCT05963698), improved risk stratification and characterization of high-risk AF patients is highly warranted.

Several clinical factors, such as those reflected in the CHA2DS2-VA(Sc)-score, and especially a high AF-burden are associated with increased risk of cardioembolic stroke. Several cardiac serum biomarkers are thought to be surrogates not only of cardiac function, but also of cardioembolic risk. Reflecting ventricular and atrial wall tension, myocardial injury, oxidative stress and thrombogenicity, elevated NT-proBNP, MR-proANP, high-sensitive Troponin T and D-Dimers have all been associated with cardioembolic stroke in different AF and non-AF populations. As the main location of thrombus formation, the left atrium (LA) and more specifically its appendage (LAA) are of particular interest in the pathogenesis of cardioembolism. Pronounced LA-enlargement, compared to a normal-sized LA, correlates with an increased risk of cardioembolism in AF-patients. As over 80% of thrombi form within the LAA, several LAA-characteristics, such as slower LAA-flow velocity and larger LAA-orifice area have also been demonstrated to be associated with higher stroke risk. Although there is data on each one of these factors, they have only been investigated in low to moderate risk populations, such as AF-patients without prior stroke, OAC-naïve patients, or even within the general population as a whole. Their role in high-risk AF-patients and in breakthrough stroke is unknown.

Hypothesis

The investigators hypothesize that specific clinical factors, serum cardiac biomarkers and markers of LA- and LAA-morphology and function are associated with breakthrough stroke / OAC-failure and may improve risk stratification.

Methods

CARE-AF is a single-center, prospective cohort study conducted at the Stroke Center of the Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. Patients with an index ischemic stroke and AF (breakthrough and non-breakthrough cases) will be enrolled. The investigators will collect clinical data, serum cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic indices of the LA and LAA. All patients will receive standardized annual follow-ups until the end of the study, defined as 12 months after the inclusion of the last participant. The primary endpoint is ischemic stroke or systemic embolism during follow-up. First, in a cross-sectional design, the study will assess the association between serum cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic indices among patients with breakthrough vs. non-breakthrough stroke as index event, applying multivariate regression models. Second, the investigators will perform a longitudinal analysis assessing the association between the variables mentioned above and breakthrough stroke as index event with the primary endpoint, using multivariate Cox regression models. The study aims to enroll a minimum of 500 patients, which provides sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful adjusted hazard ratio for recurrent stroke of 1.5 with 80% power at an alpha level of 5%.

Conclusion

The results of this project will enhance understanding of the role of specific clinical factors, cardiac serum biomarkers and echocardiographic indices in the residual risk of stroke in patients with AF on anticoagulation therapy. They may improve current risk stratification and have the potential to help guide therapeutic decisions in high-risk situations considering evolving therapeutic possibilities.",NO,"Ischemic Stroke|Atrial Fibrillation|Cerebrovascular Disorders|Brain Diseases|Central Nervous System Diseases|Vascular Diseases|Arrhythmias, Cardiac|Heart Diseases|Brain Infarction|Brain Ischemia|Infarction Cerebral|Stroke|Cardioembolic Stroke|Ischemia",OTHER: No intervention,"Composite of recurrent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, * Ischemic stroke defined as new neurological symptoms lasting \>24h and/or evidence of new ischemic lesions in neuroimaging (CT and/or MRI)

Imaging-Guided Classification \& Surgical Outcomes in Endophytic Renal Tumors

Study Goal:

This observational study investigates whether an imaging-guided classification system improves partial nephrectomy (PN) outcomes for completely endophytic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Main Question:

Does preoperative imaging classification reduce complications (e.g., ischemia time, urinary leakage) in PN for endophytic RCC compared to traditional methods?

Methods:

Patients undergoing PN for endophytic RCC will be grouped based on preoperative imaging classification. Surgical outcomes (complications, renal function) will be tracked for 5 years and compared to non-classified PN cases.

NCT06954454,"Impact of In-Person Versus Online Supervised Multicenter Multicomponent Prenatal Exercise Program on Maternal Physical Activity, Fitness, and Healthy Lifestyle",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954454,ActivePregnanc,RECRUITING,"Many studies have been supporting the positive effects of an active lifestyle concerning the prevention and treatment of pregnancy-related complications and health problems, such as gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, obesity, low back pain, urinary incontinence, anxiety or depression, as well as regarding its effectiveness in maintaining fitness and functionality, and in improving postpartum recovery.

Practice and clinical guidelines have become increasingly popular tools for synthesizing evidence-based information to assist practitioners and patients/participants in making decisions related to starting or continuing physical activity.

Despite this knowledge, most women still do not receive proper guidance on how to exercise during pregnancy or after childbirth, and the prevalence of physical inactivity is still high among pregnant and postpartum women. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for virtual approaches in health interventions, but few studies have addressed the effectiveness of such interventions.

This study is about the benefits of exercising during pregnancy in terms of maternal physical activity, fitness, and healthy lifestyle parameters. After the first visit to the doctor, pregnant women without absolute contraindications to exercise will be invited to participate in a multi-site (fitness center, university, or hospital) prenatal exercise program delivered either in person or online by qualified exercise physiologists.

The exercise intervention will follow international evidence-based guidelines. It includes aerobic, coordination, strength, postural, stretching, and pelvic floor exercises, organized in two weekly sessions lasting 60 minutes each.

Pregnant women will be asked to answer questionnaires about physical activity, fitness, and healthy lifestyle parameters (sleep, diet, stress) twice: before starting the exercise program and after completing 12 weeks of the program. The same procedure applies to basic fitness field tests (e.g., to assess balance, flexibility, strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, etc.).

Participants will have access to the free Active Pregnancy Guide (including recommendations for walking, dancing, swimming, etc.). On other days of the week, they can follow specific workouts on the YouTube channel (@GravidezAtiva-ActivePregnancy).

Researchers will test whether the exercise program is beneficial in maintaining or improving maternal physical activity and fitness levels and healthy lifestyle parameters after 12 weeks. Moreover, researchers will compare which exercise mode (in-person or virtual) is better or similar. Participants will also be asked about their satisfaction with the intervention and educational resources. Participation and resources will be free. All participants will benefit from the exercise intervention.

NCT06954350,"Pain, Sleep Quality, Eating Habits and Physical Activity Level in Patients With Bipolar Disorder",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954350,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is assumed to be a multifactorial entity including psychosocial and genetic factors whose neurobiology is still unclear.(1) BD is characterised by recurrence of mania, hypomania and depression. In the fluctuations seen in these transitions, individuals may experience changes in daily life activities and sleep status, focussing problems and cognitive fluctuations. The mortality rate due to suicide and cardiovascular diseases increases in individuals with BD (2). DSM-5TR defines BD as Bipolar I Disorder (BD-1) in the presence of one or more manic episodes, Bipolar II Disorder (BD-II) in the presence of at least one severe depressive episode accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode, Cyclothymia disorder which does not meet the criteria for BD I-II but has a course closer to normal including prolonged hypomanic and depressive episodes, It is classified as substance-induced bipolar disorder which occurs in case of intoxication or withdrawal as a result of the use of drugs or medications, bipolar or related disorder related to another medical condition, other defined bipolar and related disorder including mild and atypical symptoms, and undefined bipolar and related disorder in which symptoms are predominant but diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently present (3).

The lifetime prevalence of BD is estimated to vary between 0.6% and 1.0% for Type I and between 0.4% and 1.1% for Type II (4). Symptoms of most of the cases start between 14-21 years of age (5). Although there are no major differences between genders, depressive episodes and lifelong single marital status are more common in female individuals and substance abuse is more common in male individuals (6).

In a study examining the duration of attacks, it was reported that depression attacks were much longer than manias, but the duration of attacks did not differ between types and the mean duration of depressive and manic periods were 5.2 months and 3.5 months, respectively (7). In the manic period, the level of consciousness of the patients is generally clear and attention is increased. However, clouding of consciousness may occur due to reasons such as being physically more active than normal and disrupting or reducing eating patterns. Sudden sleep disturbances such as difficulty falling asleep and waking up at unusual hours may be a sign of mania. Excessive physical activity may cause exhaustion and weight loss with the emergence of nutritional problems. Although consciousness is intact during depression, blurred consciousness may occur in exhausted and numbness depressions (8). Increased desire for sleep, decreased appetite, exhaustion and decreased sexual desire may be observed (9).

Pain is observed in 28.9% of patients with a diagnosis of GI (10). The prevalence of pain in patients, especially chronic pain and migraine, decreases the quality of life and studies in this patient group are limited (11). Acute pain, on the other hand, has been shown in one study to be 83% of those who felt pain momentarily (12). Since chronic pain triggers recurrent thoughts of death, pain management should be a part of treatment in psychological disorders (13).

In the literature, quality of life, sleep disorder, eating disorder, physical activity, suicidal ideation and pain (localisation and intensity) of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder have been examined separately, but there are few studies on pain in bipolar disorder (14-16). In our country, it is observed that there have not been many studies on pain assessment in this patient group.",NO,Bipolar Disorder (BD),,"McGill Pain Questionnaire, The McGill Pain Questionnaire consists primarily of 3 major classes of word descriptors--sensory, affective and evaluative--that are used by patients to specify subjective pain experience.

NCT06954324,Investigation of the Effect of Erector Spinae Plane Block on Systemic Immuno-Inflammatory Index,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954324,,COMPLETED,"Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a novel interfascial block technique first described by Forero in 2016. It has been reported to be effective in various clinical indications. In ESPB, local anesthetic is injected between the deep fascia of the erector spinae muscle and the transverse process of the vertebra, allowing cephalocaudal spread along the erector spinae muscle. The goal of the injection is to provide sensory blockade by affecting the anterior rami of the spinal nerves in the region.

ESPB has been used during breast and axillary lymph node surgeries to manage postoperative pain. In addition to tumor cells, immune and inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, platelets, and lymphocytes contribute to the dissemination and invasion of tumor cells into the peripheral circulation. Noninvasive biomarkers such as serum inflammatory markers are increasingly valued for their simplicity and predictive potential. Platelets have been shown to facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells; neutrophils support tumor adhesion via growth factors such as VEGF and proteases; lymphocytes play a role in modulating the host immune response to malignancy.

The systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), calculated as (platelet count × neutrophil count) / lymphocyte count, is a relatively new composite marker that reflects immune and inflammatory responses. It has been evaluated as a prognostic biomarker in several cancer-related studies.

Postoperative pain and surgical stress activate systemic inflammatory responses.

NCT06954311,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring for Biological Therapy in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954311,TDMpIBD,RECRUITING,"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and the unclassified form referred to as indeterminate colitis, are most commonly diagnosed during adolescence and early adulthood. In recent decades, an increasing incidence of IBD has been observed in this age group.

A wide range of immunomodulatory agents, from corticosteroids to monoclonal antibodies, are now available for the treatment of IBD. These antibodies, known as biologics, target, for example, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α; e.g., infliximab and adalimumab), integrin α4β7 (vedolizumab), or interleukin-12/23 (ustekinumab). While infliximab and adalimumab are approved for pediatric use in CD and UC, vedolizumab is only approved for moderate-to-severe UC from the age of 16, and ustekinumab is not approved for pediatric use at all. Nevertheless, vedolizumab and ustekinumab are frequently used off-label in cases of treatment failure with approved therapies, as efficacy has been demonstrated in adult IBD patients, and since 2015, increasing pediatric literature has emerged on their use.

To facilitate appropriate dose adjustment in pediatric clinical practice, biologic therapies can be monitored through measurement of drug trough levels. Current pediatric guidelines already recommend incorporating therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of infliximab and adalimumab in the management of CD and UC. Studies on TDM for vedolizumab and ustekinumab have so far been conducted almost exclusively in adult IBD patients, where improved treatment responses have also been demonstrated.

The presented research is a prospective, non-interventional observational study involving pediatric IBD patients at multiple Austrian pediatric gastroenterology centers. The study duration is five years. The aim is to include at least 40 patients receiving induction and maintenance therapy with infliximab or adalimumab, and 20 patients treated with vedolizumab or ustekinumab during both treatment phases. The primary objective is to gain a better understanding of the pharmacokinetic dynamics of these biologics and the associated treatment response in pediatric settings. Data will be collected exclusively from routine clinical assessments. No additional study-related visits or interventions are planned.",NO,Ulcerative Colitis (UC)|IBD-unclassified (IBD-U),,"Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Plasma Level of Biological Therapy, Plasma levels of Infliximab, Adalimumab, Vedolizumab, and Ustekinumab will be assessed during routine follow-up visits, provided that such measurements are clinically indicated, in accordance with the non-interventional nature of the study design. The levels are measured in µg/ml., Plasma Levels will be assessed at Baseline and approximately at Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 54 during routine follow-up visits. Actual timing may vary slightly due to the non-interventional nature of the study.","Time Course of Disease Activity (clinical assessments), Disease activity is assessed using validated clinical scoring systems. In patients with Crohn's disease, the weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) is applied, which ranges from 0 to 125 points; higher scores indicate increased disease activity. For patients with ulcerative colitis, the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) is used, with a scoring range of 0 to 85 points-again, higher values reflect greater disease severity., Clinical outcome scores will be assessed at Baseline and approximately at Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 54 during routine follow-up visits. Actual timing may vary slightly due to the non-interventional nature of the study|Time course of Disease Activity (laboratory assessments), Disease activity is assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin levels, a biomarker indicative of intestinal inflammation.

If detectable, these antibodies will be quantified and reported in ng/mL. The presence of elevated anti-drug antibody levels has been linked to reduced treatment efficacy and an increased risk of therapeutic failure. The probability of developing anti-drug antibodies is relatively low; therefore, multiple time points are assessed to ensure accurate detection and monitoring over the course of treatment., Anti-drug antibody Levels will be assessed at Baseline and approximately at Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 54 during routine follow-up visits.

Due to their chronic and incurable nature, they are serious diseases that cause physical pain in patients and reduced quality of life. Atopic dermatitis is the most common inflammatory skin disease with a prevalence of almost 20% in children and 10% in adults. Current therapies are designed to control the condition rather than cure it. Therefore, these therapies are lifelong and, when the disease is flaring, must be used intensively to achieve control. Despite the emergence of various therapies, topical corticosteroids (TCS) remains the gold standard therapy generally used as a first-line treatment. However, if used inappropriately, it can act like a double-edged sword. With the beneficial action of TCS comes the potential for undesirable effects, like skin thinning, especially when used long-term or excessively.

The objective of this study is to define the normal structural parameters for healthy skin in a diverse cohort, determine the effect of age, sex, and ethnicity and subsequently study how these values differ in clinically abnormal skin resulting from excessive or inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids (TCS).

While this surgery is known to carry a risk of affecting ejaculation, its potential impact on other areas such as urination or erection is not well understood.

The study will prospectively follow adult men undergoing RPLND. It will assess changes in lower urinary tract symptoms, urine flow, ejaculation, erection, and overall quality of life before surgery and during follow-up visits up to 6 months after the operation. Patients will complete standardized questionnaires and undergo simple, non-invasive tests such as urine flow measurement.

It will also learn about individual difference predictors of intervention outcomes. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Will the explicit intervention (Shape Coding+syntactic priming) on relative clause production lead to better outcomes than implicit intervention (syntactic priming only)?
2. Can pre-intervention procedural learning, working memory (WM) capacities, and grammar impairment severity predict the intervention outcomes across children with DLD?
3. Will 10 intervention sessions (500 doses of the target structure) lead to learning progress in children with DLD, even with implicit intervention, and will the progress plateau at some point of the intervention?

Researchers will compare the explicit intervention to the implicit intervention to see if the explicit intervention leads to better interventional outcomes.

Participants will:

* Undergo diagnostic assessments of DLD to confirm their DLD status.
* Complete pre-intervention assessments to assess their procedural learning and working memory capacities.

NCT06954168,"The Effects of Smoking on Sleep Quality, Fatigue and Perceived Stress",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954168,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Tobacco use is a major cause of death resulting from cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and pulmonary disorders. It is also a risk factor for respiratory and other infections, osteoporosis, diabetes, reproductive disorders, adverse surgical outcomes and delayed wound healing, as well as duodenal and gastric ulcers \[1\]. Studies project that the number of deaths due to smoking will rise to 8.4 million by 2030 \[2\]. According to the Tobacco Atlas, in Turkey, 83,100 people die each year due to smoking-related causes.

The negative effects of smoking are not limited to chronic diseases; it can also affect the quality of daily life. In a study involving 3,516 participants, it was reported that both male and female smokers experienced significantly greater difficulty falling asleep compared to non-smokers. They also suffered from non-restorative sleep, frequent awakenings during the night, and difficulty falling back asleep \[3\]. Furthermore, literature has demonstrated a significant relationship between smoking and perceived stress \[4\]. Perceived stress is defined as ""the feelings or thoughts an individual has about how much stress they are under during a particular period"" \[5\]. Although smoking may temporarily alleviate perceived stress, studies suggest it may actually lead to negative emotional states or exacerbate stress in the long run \[6, 7\]. In addition, it has been found that smokers tend to feel more tired and become fatigued more quickly compared to non-smokers \[8, 9\].

The majority of smokers begin smoking during adolescence \[10\]. In their study, Burt et al. reported that 71% of smokers started smoking at or before the age of 18 \[11\]. The university period is a critical phase in young individuals' lives, and habits formed during this time can have long-term health consequences. Smoking can affect not only health but also academic performance \[12\]. Factors such as stress \[13\], sleep quality \[14\], and fatigue \[15\], which have previously been studied in smokers, have also been shown to negatively impact academic achievement. Although academic success will not be directly evaluated in our study, considering the target population, the potential secondary effect of smoking on academic performance further underscores the significance of our research.

This study is designed to compare university students who smoke and those who do not in terms of sleep quality, fatigue, and perceived stress levels. Although there are existing studies that examine these parameters individually or in different populations, to our knowledge, no study has simultaneously assessed all of these factors in a university student sample. Most studies in this field focus on the general population; however, university students represent a specific group due to their stressful academic lives, social pressures, and lifestyle changes. The originality of our study lies in its focus on university students and its comprehensive approach to examining multiple variables concurrently. In this context, the planned research will provide more specific and detailed insights into the factors associated with nicotine dependence and their interrelationships.",NO,University Students,,"The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, only once|The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Scoring, only once|The Fatigue Assessment Scale, only once|The Perceived Stress Scale, only once",,,Barış SEVEN,The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,528,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,7,2025-04-25,2025-05-30,2025-06-27,2025-05-01,,2025-05-01,,

NCT06953973,Investigation of the Effectiveness of Tecar Therapy in Patients With Chronic Neck Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953973,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Study Design This study was planned as a randomized controlled, double-blind study. Chronic neck pain diagnosed by a specialist physician will be divided into 3 groups with a randomization model. Interested individuals will be included in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria and sign the 'Informed Voluntary Consent Form' after the study is explained.

Patients will be divided into 3 groups with a randomization (secretary not in the study) model.

Patients who choose 1 will be applied Tecar Therapy + Standard Physiotherapy Program (SFP), those who choose 2 will be applied Sham Tecar Therapy +SFP and those who choose 3 will be applied SFP. The first and last evaluations of all 3 groups will be made by the same blind evaluator.

Randomization After the study is explained to the patients with chronic neck pain who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, those who volunteer will be asked to sign the ""Informed Voluntary Consent Form"". Those who volunteer to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to Group 1, Group 2 or 3. Participants will be randomly assigned to a card. Those who draw number 1 will be assigned to the SFP+Tecar Therapy group, those who draw number 2 will be assigned to the Sham Tecar Therapy + SFP group, and those who draw number 3 will be assigned to the SFP only group.

Visual Analog Scale (VAS) The pain intensity felt by the participants in the knee joint during rest and activity will be evaluated with VAS. VAS is an easy-to-use scale as it does not have any language and is frequently applied in clinics. Individuals will be asked to describe the pain they feel during the test on a 10 cm scale as ""0"" (no pain) and ""10"" (unbearable pain). A 34% decrease in VAS after TKA is considered clinically significant.

Neck Disability Index Neck Disability Index (NDI) was developed by Vernon et al. The Turkish version study was conducted by Aslan et al. The NDI includes a total of 10 questions such as pain, personal care, concentration, work, driving, and sleeping. Each question is scored between 0 and 5 points. A score of 0 means no restriction, and a score of 50 means full restriction. A score between 0-4 indicates no restriction, a score between 5-14 indicates mild restriction, a score between 14-24 indicates moderate restriction, a score between 25-34 indicates severe restriction, and a score above 35 indicates restriction.

Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale TKÖ is a 17-question checklist and is used in acute and chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal injuries, and whiplash-related diseases. The scale uses a 4-point Likert scale (1= I strongly disagree, 4= I strongly agree). A total score is calculated after reversing items 4, 8, 12, and 16. The person receives a total score between 17-68. A high score on the scale indicates that the person has high kinesiophobia. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire in Turkish was conducted by Tunca Yılmaz et al.

Quality of Life (SF-12) SF-12 consists of 8 sub-dimensions and 12 items, including physical functioning (2 items), physical role (2 items), body pain (1 item), general health (1 item), energy (1 item), social functioning (1 item), emotional role (2 items) and mental health (2 items). While the items related to physical and emotional role are answered dichotomously (yes or no), other items have Likert-type options ranging from 3 to 6. The total score of the survey varies between 0-100, with higher scores representing better health. The validity and reliability of the survey in Turkish was performed by Soylu et al.

Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale The scale is used to determine the risk of anxiety and depression in patients, and to measure their levels and changes in severity. The scale consists of a total of 14 questions. Seven of these (odd numbers) measure anxiety, while the other seven (even numbers) measure depression. The scale provides a four-point Likert-type measurement. Each item is scored differently. Items 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13 show decreasing severity and are scored in the form of 3, 2, 1, 0. On the other hand, items 2, 4, 7, 9, 12 and 14 are scored in the form of 0, 1, 2, 3. The total scores of the subscales are obtained by adding these item scores. While items 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 are added for the anxiety subscale, the scores of items 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 are added for the depression subscale. Each heading is scored between 0-21. High scores indicate high anxiety and depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was developed by Zigmond and Snaith in 1983. In our country, the validity and reliability study was conducted by Aydemir in 1997.

Although medical treatments have advanced, CD still leads to significant health issues due to disease progression and medication side effects. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a recommended first-line treatment for pediatric CD, proving more effective than oral corticosteroids without side effects. However, EEN demands strict adherence, making it challenging for patients, particularly adults.

In 2019, Levine et al. found that a combination of a specific diet (CD exclusion diet, CDED) and partial enteral nutrition (PEN) was as effective as EEN in inducing remission in pediatric patients, with better tolerance and adherence. CDED focuses on whole foods and aims to minimize harmful dietary components affecting the gut.

In clinical practice, an adapted CDED (aCDED) has been used to provide more food choices, but it lacks validation in clinical trials. An aCDED that considers regional and seasonal food variations could enhance patient adherence and align with modern dietary preferences.

* Atrial fibrillation is a common heart condition in which one of the heart chambers doesn't follow a normal rhythm. Blood clots can form as a result, and they can travel to the brain and cause strokes, or to other organs.
* Almost everyone with atrial fibrillation is treated with drugs called anticoagulants (""blood thinners"") to reduce the risk of stroke. These drugs also increase the risk of bleeding.
* Testing for atrial fibrillation is usually done for patients who have symptoms of an irregular or unusually fast or slow heartbeat, often called ""palpitations"" or a sensation of the heart pounding or stopping for a short period of time.
* What is not known is whether screening people who do not have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, but who are at above-average risk of getting atrial fibrillation, will reduce death, hospitalization for stroke, blood clots, heart failure more than it increases hospitalization for severe bleeding.

NCT06953752,Effects of Music During Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Under Conscious Sedation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953752,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"I. Background Atrial fibrillation, a common type of arrhythmia, is often treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation, a minimally invasive procedure that helps restore a normal heart rhythm. While this surgery is typically performed under ""light sedation"" (where patients remain semi-awake) and allows for quick recovery, many patients still experience significant anxiety during the procedure due to pain, unfamiliar surroundings, or concerns about surgical risks. Research shows that anxiety not only makes people more sensitive to pain but can also trigger physical tension, irregular breathing, and even affect the precision of the surgeon's movements-potentially prolonging the procedure or increasing the risk of complications.

Currently, hospitals primarily rely on sedatives and painkillers to ease patient discomfort. However, these medications may cause side effects like low blood pressure or slowed breathing, which can be particularly dangerous for older patients with heart conditions. As a safer alternative, non-drug approaches like music therapy are gaining attention. Studies suggest that listening to music can reduce anxiety and pain in other medical settings (such as during biopsies or pre-surgery preparation), likely because it helps the body relax, reduces stress hormones, or distracts the mind. Yet, there's limited evidence on whether music can provide similar benefits during atrial fibrillation catheter ablation, especially in helping patients maintain steady breathing.

To address this gap, the present study aims to explore how music interventions affect anxiety, pain, and breathing stability in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation catheter ablation. Investigators hope this research will offer practical solutions to improve patient comfort, reduce reliance on medications, and enhance surgical safety, while also providing scientific support for expanding non-drug therapies in cardiac procedures.

II. Study Purpose To evaluate whether music during atrial fibrillation catheter ablation helps reduce patients' anxiety and pain, stabilize breathing, and improve satisfaction for both patients and doctors while making the procedure more efficient.

With binaural hearing, listeners benefit from perceiving sounds from different spatial locations. This is critical in solving the ""cocktail party problem"" (i.e., understanding speech in the presence of competing background sounds and noise). As humans get older, hearing loss increases, binaural abilities decrease, and the cocktail party problem becomes increasingly difficult. This research studies the mechanisms underlying the impact of age and hearing loss on speech-perception in noise and cocktail-party listening situations. More specifically, the role of hearing asymmetries between the ears is investigated. The specific aims are to generate an audiological and binaural-hearing-focused dataset for a large cohort of participants that vary in hearing asymmetry, age, and hearing loss and to use machine learning to uncover complex associations and generate novel hypotheses relating audiometric variables and basic binaural-hearing abilities to the cocktail-party problem.

With time, the grief response decreases and people learn to cope with their loss. However, for some, the response becomes more intense and distressing. This is called prolonged grief disorder (PGD). People with PGD experience emotional pain and a deep longing for their loved one. PGD normally occurs \<10% of people after a loss, but it has become more common since the COVID-19 pandemic (\~30%). If left untreated, PGD leads to poor quality of life and increased risk of death. Treatment options such as medication and therapy are available; however, they can cause negative side effects and take a long time to work. To help individuals with PGD, we need treatments that work well and quickly.

NCT06953427,The Impact of Age on Short-term Post-thrombectomy Outcomes in Patients Aged 70 or Beyond With Acute Ischemic Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953427,,COMPLETED,"A recent Cochrane systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing endovascular intervention-either mechanical thrombectomy or intra-arterial thrombolysis combined with medical treatment-to conservative medical treatment alone provided high-certainty evidence that endovascular intervention increases the likelihood of achieving a favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale \[mRS\] score of 0-2) by 50% in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).1 More recently, a cross-Atlantic RCT was conducted to determine whether endovascular therapy (EVT) plus medical care is superior to medical care alone in patients with acute proximal cerebral vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and large infarcts, regardless of infarct size. The study confirmed a 63% increased odds of a favorable outcome with EVT plus medical care. In real-world registries of EVT for AIS due to large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, approximately one-half of patients are aged 70 and older, while 13% to 39% are aged 80 and beyond. In patients aged 70 and beyond who are EVT-eligible, post-procedure mortality increases progressively with increasing age. A prospective European study found that each additional year of age was associated with an 8% decline in the likelihood of achieving a favorable functional outcome. In elderly patients, increasing age is more than just a number-it reflects a higher likelihood of significant medical comorbidities, polypharmacy, declining functional status, compromised nutritional status, and weakened immune function. Research on age as a predictor of EVT outcomes often compares elderly patients to much younger counterparts. However, contrasting post-EVT outcomes in older adults with those under 70 is neither realistic nor appropriate due to inherent differences in baseline health, comorbidities, and physiological resilience. Therefore, the investigators analyzed a prospectively registered cohort to assess whether age influences post-EVT functional outcomes, using septuagenarians as the control group.",NO,Acute Cerebral Ischemia|Endovascular Thrombectomy|Prognosis|Age Factors|Interventional Radiology|Elderly (Aged &gt;70),,"Post-endovascular thrombectomy modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) reperfusion grade, Modified Treatment In Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) scale:

NCT06953362,Deciphering Principles of Network Dynamics Underlying Depression Symptom Severity From Multi-day Intracranial Recordings in Patients With Major Depression,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953362,,COMPLETED,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In the current project, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period. In this ancillary study to the parent clinical trial, we carry out a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This study is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. This project builds on our preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments.",NO,Treatment Resistant Depression,DEVICE: Direct Neural Electrical Stimulation,"Network Connectivity and Activity Pattern: Relationship to Symptom Severity and Impact of Neurostimulation, The pattern of network connectivity and activity that is associated with symptom severity and the effect of intracranial electrical stimulation on the connectivity and activity pattern., Up to 10 days",,,"University of California, San Francisco",National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,6,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,5R21MH124759|5R21MH124759,2021-01-01,2024-12-31,2024-12-31,2025-05-01,,2025-05-01,"UCSF, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States",

NCT06953310,Assessing the Effects of a Multisectoral Agricultural Intervention on the Reproductive and Sexual Health of Adolescent Girls and Young Women,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953310,Vijana Shamba,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In Kenya, HIV incidence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) ages 15-24 years is 1-2 per 100 person-years and approximately 30% of AGYW have had at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI). Kisumu and Migori counties in Western Kenya have some of the highest HIV/STI incidence in the country. Food insecurity (FI) and poverty are also highly prevalent in Western Kenya. FI and poverty are important drivers of vulnerability to HIV and STIs among AGYW. Poverty alleviation interventions have the potential to reduce STIs and HIV risk among AGYW but, to date, these interventions have reported mixed findings on HIV/STI outcomes, have been primarily targeted at the individual level, and none have focused on agriculture or FI. Therefore, there remains a critical need to develop sustainable, multi-level, economic and FI interventions that improve AGYW STI/HIV prevention outcomes. Our team has successfully developed a household-level agricultural intervention in Western Kenya called Shamba Maisha (""farm life"" in Kiswahili; SM) to reduce household FI. In our prior pilot study with AGYW, the investigators found that SM was feasible, acceptable, and associated with less FI and improved mental health. In this proposal, the investigators will build upon our promising SM work by examining the effectiveness and implementation of our SM intervention, including provision of a water pump and agricultural implements for use at home, training in agriculture delivered at school-based demonstration farms, and adolescent-caregiver relationship strengthening training. The investigators plan to conduct this school- and home-based cluster randomized trial with 800 AGYW and their primary caregivers recruited from schools in Kisumu and Migori counties. The investigators will randomize 20 schools in Kisumu and Migori in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control conditions and follow AGYW-caregiver dyads for 18 months with surveys and STI/pregnancy testing to assess intervention impacts. The study has the following aims: Aim 1. Determine the impact of SM on adolescent HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health outcomes (primary outcome is gonorrhea and/or chlamydia incidence). Aim 2. Assess the effect of SM on intermediate outcomes theorized from our published conceptual framework to be on the causal pathway, including household food security and wealth, and adolescent and caregiver factors including mental health and aspects of the caregiver-AGYW relationship dyad (e.g., communication). Aim 3. Identify critical implementation facilitators and barriers influencing SM effectiveness and delivery and conduct a programmatic cost assessment. The investigators will also evaluate the extent to which SM can have ""spillover"" nutritional benefits for a larger population of adolescents who had access to demonstration farms at intervention schools but did not receive other aspects of the intervention.

Long-length eccentric training has shown promise in enhancing muscle performance, but its effects in older adults, particularly in a home-based setting, remain underexplored.

The aim of this trial is to assess whether a targeted home-based training intervention incorporating long-length eccentric contractions can enhance functional capacity and neuromechanical properties in healthy older adults. Participants will be semi-randomly allocated to one of two groups: an experimental group incorporating long-length eccentric contractions (Group 1) or a conventional resistance training group (Group 2), with group assignment stratified to ensure an equal number of men and women in each group. Each participant will complete three laboratory-based experimental sessions (i.e., two Pre-training sessions and one Post-training session) , during which five key evaluations will be conducted: (i) the 5-Time Sit to Stand test, serving as the primary outcome measure; (ii) the Timed Up and Go test; (iii) assessments of isometric and dynamic muscle strength in the knee extensors and plantar flexors; (iv) measurements of the cross-sectional areas of the vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, and soleus muscles; and (v) evaluation of tendon stiffness.

However, the relationship between 2D:4D ratio and proprioception is not well-known, which was therefore aimed at investigating in current study. Methods: 2D:4D ratio (electronic digital calliper) and proprioception (Join position error is measure with Cervical Range of Motion instrument) were assessed in all individuals (n=35.7 ± 11.2 years).",NO,Proprioception,,"Finger length measurement and 2D:4D ratio calculation, The lengths of the second (2D) and fourth (4D) fingers on each hand were measured using an electronic digital caliper with a precision of 0.01 millimeters. Measurements were taken on the palmar surface of the hand, extending from the distal tip of the finger to the basal crease at the proximal end of the digit.The 2D:4D ratio was calculated separately for the right and left hands. To enhance the accuracy of the 2D:4D ratio measurements, each finger was measured three times during a single assessment session by the same investigator. The repeated measurements were not taken consecutively; instead, at least one other hand was measured between the first and second measurements of any given hand. This procedure was implemented to minimize the potential influence of recall bias on subsequent measurements., baseline|Cervical Range of Motion, The cervical range of motion measurement was performed using a Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) device, which is a reliable and valid tool. The CROM unit is a mechanical instrument that measures cervical ranges by combining a magnetic reference with standard inclinometers. The individuals were told to sit comfortably with their hands on the armrest and their backs straight on the chair. The CROM unit was secured on the individuals' head by the physiotherapist. The CROM unit's magnetic yoke is positioned squarely around the neck with its arrow pointing directly north. Afterwards, physiotherapist asked individuals to perform cervical range of motion in all three directions: flexion- extension, lateral flexion and rotation.The maximum range of cervical flexion, extension, left and right rotation, and left and right lateral flexion was measured three times and averaged., baseline|Repositioning to neutral head position (NHP), For the NHP assessment, the individuals were asked to keep their head in the neutral head position, with their eyes closed.

While the patient's eyes are covered with an eye mask, the head will first be slowly positioned by the physiotherapist to the predetermined target angle and held in this position for five seconds for the patient to perceive. Subsequently, the head will be moved away from the target position, and the patient will be asked to actively reposition it to the original target. Each measurement will be repeated three times, and the mean deviation from the target angle will be recorded.

NCT06953167,Cognitive Health in Ageing Register: Investigational and Observational Trial Studies in Dementia Research (CHARIOT): Prospective Readiness Cohort (PRO) Longitudinal Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953167,CPLS,RECRUITING,"Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative condition affecting the brain and is the most frequent form of dementia in older adults. Dementia is currently a major healthcare issue in the UK, affecting approximately a million people. The progression of the disease varies between individuals and the early stages may be characterised by only minimal changes in memory and thinking. These changes could remain undetected as the symptoms may be mistakenly regarded as normal age-related forgetfulness. However, dementia is not part of the normal ageing process.

The disease process is now known to start at least 20 years prior to the emergence of symptoms. A protein called amyloid starts to deposit in the brain, forming clumps referred to as 'plaques'. Another protein called tau sticks to other tau molecules inside the brain cell and forms structures called 'tangles'. These changes cause damage to the brain cells, disrupting their normal functioning, leading to inflammation and ultimately destruction of the brain cells.

So far, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but by better understanding the changes that occur over time in the brain, scientists can find ways of detecting and therefore diagnosing and treating the disease earlier. One way in which scientists learn about how a disease develops, is by following people unaffected by the condition over an extended period of time. The same tests and sample collections are repeated to monitor any clinical changes. These are known as longitudinal studies, and CHARIOT:PRO studies are examples of this.

The CHARIOT:PRO Longitudinal Study (CPLS) is an observational study of 600 participants aged \>65 years old which aims to evaluate cognition (thinking abilities) and biomarkers (biological markers which indicate the presence of disease e.g. amyloid) over time in older adults. The participants in CPLS were all screened as part of the CHARIOT:PRO Sub-Study (CPSS1) in 2015-2017.

Visit 1 will be conducted within eight weeks after the Study Entry Visit (SEV). Visits 2-7 will follow at six-monthly intervals from Visit 1. During visits, information relating to health, medication, family history of dementia, self-reported cognitive function and anthropometrics will be collected. The cognitive assessments PACC5 and RBANS will be administered along with a measure of executive function (Trail Making Test). Participants will be provided with self-reported questionnaires to be completed at each onsite visit. Blood samples will be taken once a year i.e. Month 0, 12, 24 and 36.

The purpose of CPLS is to continue to build on the vital data and samples already kindly donated by participants screened for CPSS1. This will provide valuable information that will enhance understanding of the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease before obvious symptoms start to appear. Importantly, the Investigators hope to identify predictive markers of disease, which will help doctors to select the right drugs, and develop other approaches like lifestyle guidance to prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease in the future.

Early diagnosis, along with prompt and appropriate management, has become a major challenge for emergency departments. However, it is often difficult to determine whether sepsis is the primary factor behind clinical decompensation, especially in patients with complex comorbidities where symptoms may be nonspecific and overlap with other causes of deterioration. This diagnostic uncertainty complicates the timely initiation of targeted treatment, making the role of biomarkers even more crucial.

The measurement of sepsis biomarkers is widely used in clinical practice to enhance diagnostic accuracy, but there remains a need for a more reliable biomarker. A biomarker with higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) is essential for the early initiation of treatment. Several European and American studies have demonstrated the added value of MDW as an early predictor of sepsis in patients admitted to intensive care units, as well as its diagnostic performance when combined with the qSOFA score.

In the literature, the MDW threshold is established at 21.5, offering optimal diagnostic power with good sensitivity and specificity, supporting its clinical application and its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Conformity (CE).

NCT06953115,Vagal Stimulation Therapy and Preeclampsia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953115,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Preeclampsia is one of the most common and serious complications of pregnancy, affecting both the mother and baby. It is a condition characterized by high blood pressure and can lead to severe complications, including neurological issues and reduced blood flow to the placenta. Preeclampsia is responsible for a significant number of maternal and perinatal deaths worldwide, with an estimated 14% of maternal mortality in Mexico linked to this condition.

Recent research suggests that disruptions in the body's autonomic nervous system, specifically the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, play a role in the development of preeclampsia. The vagus nerve, which is part of the parasympathetic system, has been shown to regulate inflammation and blood pressure. Stimulating this nerve through pharmacological, magnetic, electrical, or physical therapy techniques has shown promise in preclinical models for improving blood pressure control and reducing complications associated with preeclampsia.

Trigger point release therapy modulates the nervous system by reducing sympathetic activity, promoting blood vessel relaxation, lowering heart rate, and enhancing circulation. When combined with standard antihypertensive treatment, this approach may offer additional benefits for blood pressure regulation.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of vagal autonomic stimulation physiotherapy using trigger point release therapy as a complementary treatment for pregnant women with preeclampsia. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either standard antihypertensive treatment with positional release therapy (control group) or the same treatment combined with vagal stimulation physiotherapy (intervention group). Researchers will assess the intervention's effectiveness in controlling blood pressure and improving overall maternal and fetal health outcomes.

Risk factors include African descent, nulliparity, obesity, and diabetes. While many fibroids are asymptomatic, 25-50% of affected women experience symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and pressure-related issues. Accurate diagnosis and differentiation from rare malignant tumors (e.g., uterine sarcomas) remain challenging, particularly before surgery.

Ultrasound is the first-line tool for evaluating fibroids, with specific features (e.g., shape, vascularity) helping distinguish benign from suspicious lesions. The MUSA guidelines standardize ultrasound terminology for myometrial assessments. Current treatment options vary based on symptoms and malignancy risk.

NCT06953037,"Effects of Acupressure Applied Before Cesarean Delivery on Anxiety, Physiological Parameters and Fetal Heart Rate",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953037,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Cesarean section is the most commonly preferred surgical method in cases where vaginal birth is not possible or complications that may endanger the health of the mother and baby occur. Cesarean section rates are increasing worldwide. According to the latest data (2010-2018) from 154 countries covering 94.5% of live births in the world, 21.1% of women have cesarean section births and it is estimated that this rate will increase to 28.5% by 2030. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the cesarean section rate in the USA, which was 32.1% in 2022, increased to 32.4% in 2023. When the cesarean section rates of the Turkey Demographic Health Survey (TDHS) are examined, the rate, which was 7% in 1993, increased to 52% in 2018, an increase of 45% is observed. In the TRNC, this rate was 11.1% in 1981, but in 2017 this rate increased by an average of 7 times, reaching 72.5%. Pregnant women tend to have cesarean sections because they are affected by the risks that will occur during birth, negative birth stories told among the public, and painful birth scenes seen on social media. Studies have shown that despite the high rates of cesarean sections in pregnant women's birth methods, a significant increase in women's anxiety levels is observed. While waiting for the surgery, pre-operative anxiety, fear of the procedure, etc. are more common than other feelings and symptoms.Studies have also shown that anxiety increases in patient rooms, the night before surgery, and when moving to the operating table. In a study conducted by Lopez, the most important causes of preoperative anxiety were listed as fear of the hospital environment (35%), fear of surgery (33%), fear of anesthesia (45%), and unawareness of the surgery (45%). Concerns about the success of the operation (29.3%), fear of postoperative prognosis (19.5%), and surgical complications (11.4%) are the most common causes of preoperative anxiety. High levels of anxiety experienced before surgery cause increased heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption during surgery.

Controlling and managing preoperative anxiety is one of the most important goals of nursing care worldwide, as in cesarean cases. Mothers need to relax mentally and physically after cesarean sections so that they can care for their babies after birth. A common way to control preoperative anxiety is to use sedatives, but these medications can cause side effects. Therefore, acupressure, which is a non-invasive, low-cost, uncomplicated and non-pharmacological method due to fewer complications, can be used to reduce preoperative anxiety. Acupressure is the application of pressure to stimulate acupoints and meridian lines using an object or fingers, without the use of needles. Acupressure is a simple treatment approach and can be applied by nurses or patients who have received the necessary training, because it is simple and does not require any equipment.",NO,Caesarean Section|Pregnant Women|Anxiety Disorder,OTHER: acupressure,"State Anxiety Scale, The state anxiety scale was developed by Spielberg et al.

Accordingly, the lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 20, and the highest score is 80. An increase in the score obtained from the scale indicates that state anxiety has developed.

NCT06952985,Role of Gum Chewing in Post-operative Gut Motility After Cesarean Section,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952985,,COMPLETED,"Many women deliver by caesarean section nowadays. The proportion of women who deliver by caesarean section ranges from 15% to over 50%, in some countries. After a caesarean section it is common for the bowel to stop working for several hours or days. Although this usually resolves by itself in a few days, it may be very uncomfortable. The retained gases and stools can cause the mother's belly to become swollen and painful with cramps and she may feel nauseated and vomit so she is not able to eat. She may need additional medications to ease these symptoms and her hospital discharge may be delayed. The use of medications that relieve pain during labour and painkillers following the surgery can also delay bowel function. Small intestine activity after abdominal operations returns to normal function within a few hours, gastric activity returns to normal within 24-48 hours, and colon activity returns to normal within 48-72 hours. Due to the delayed motility of the gastrointestinal system in the postoperative period, gas and secretions accumulate in the stomach and small and large intestines, which causes abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and pain, all of which negatively affect the comfort level of the patients.

NCT06952907,Femoral Versus Radial Invasive Arterial Pressure Monitoring in Cardiac Surgery Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952907,FERARI,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background: Acute circulatory failure, often presenting as arterial hypotension, is a major contributor to postoperative morbidity and mortality. Accurate blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential for timely therapeutic intervention, particularly in patients undergoing major surgery. Among invasive BP measurement sites, the radial artery is commonly used due to its accessibility and ease of catheterization. However, physiologically, the radial artery may underestimate central arterial pressure compared to the femoral artery, especially in patients receiving vasopressors or in critical conditions. This discrepancy can lead to overtreatment with vasopressors and associated complications. Current literature on the accuracy of radial versus femoral BP monitoring is outdated and based solely on observational studies. There is a lack of high-quality randomized data to inform clinical guidelines.

Hypothesis: Femoral arterial pressure monitoring, by offering more accurate hemodynamic data, reduces the need for vasopressor support, particularly norepinephrine, compared to radial artery monitoring.

Primary Objective: To compare the effect of femoral versus radial invasive BP monitoring on the proportion of patients requiring norepinephrine at postoperative day 7 (D7) following elective cardiac surgery.

Secondary Objectives :To compare the following outcomes between the two strategies within the first 7 postoperative days: incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) based on KDIGO criteria, incidence of cardiac complications: arrhythmias requiring treatment, myocardial injury or infarction, cardiac arrest, vaso-inotropic score (VIS), duration of vasopressor therapy, incidence of arterial catheter-related complications, 7-day postoperative mortality

Primary Endpoint: The proportion of patients receiving continuous intravenous norepinephrine from anesthesia induction to postoperative day 7.

Secondary Endpoints: AKI occurrence or need for renal replacement therapy; cardiac complications: atrial/ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial injury (troponin \>99th percentile or \>20% rise from baseline), myocardial infarction (biomarker elevation + ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities), cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest; maximum VIS in the OR, ICU admission, and day 1; total norepinephrine support duration (in hours); arterial line complications: insertion failure, device dysfunction, hematoma, thrombosis, local infection, mortality at day 7

Study Design: A prospective, multicenter (Besançon and Dijon University Hospitals), randomized, superiority, single-blind, intention-to-treat clinical trial in adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients are randomized to femoral or radial artery catheterization for continuous BP monitoring.

Sample Size: Based on an expected norepinephrine use rate of 70%, a 15% absolute risk reduction, α = 0.05, and power = 90%, 162 patients per group are required. Accounting for 5% data loss, 335 patients will be enrolled.

Study Arms:

Radial group: invasive BP monitoring via radial artery catheterization Femoral group: invasive BP monitoring via femoral artery catheterization The arterial line is placed under ultrasound guidance in the operating room and maintained postoperatively in the ICU or critical care unit until no longer clinically indicated.

Eligibility Criteria Inclusion: adults aged 18-80 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery with informed consent.

Exclusion: emergency surgery, use of dual arterial lines, heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory support, contraindications to radial/femoral catheterization, legal or ethical inability to consent.

Study Timeline Inclusion period: 36 months Patient follow-up: 7 days post-surgery Total study duration: 36 months

Data Collection: Clinical data are collected by research staff using an electronic case report form (e-CRF) via CleanWeb™ software.

Expected Impact: There are currently no guidelines specifying the optimal site for invasive BP monitoring. This study aims to provide robust evidence on whether femoral BP monitoring improves clinical outcomes, reduces vasopressor use, and minimizes adverse events.

NCT06952751,Optimization of the Isolation Protocol for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) From Human Follicular Fluid,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952751,,RECRUITING,"Background: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles found in all biological fluids, containing various regulatory molecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs). It has been suggested that the EVs in human follicular fluid (the fluid surrounding the oocyte within the ovary) play a crucial role in oocyte development through these miRNAs. However, several methods exist for isolating these EVs from follicular fluid. Before further research can be conducted on the pathophysiology and potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of these EVs and their content, the optimal isolation technique must be determined for future studies.

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the purity and efficiency may vary between species and different biological fluids. There are only a limited number of studies comparing the various techniques for application in human follicular fluid.

Objective: This study will compare the three most commonly used techniques for isolating EVs: size-based, sedimentation-based (differential ultracentrifugation), and buoyancy-based isolation techniques.

Methodology:

In this prospective study, follicular fluid will be collected from four patients undergoing transvaginal oocyte retrieval following ovarian stimulation at Ghent University Hospital. Patients over 40 years of age or with endometriosis, adenomyosis, or PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) will not be included in this study. During the oocyte retrieval procedure, follicular fluid will be collected from 2-4 oocytes per patient. Since follicular fluid is not used in the patient's treatment (residual material), it does not affect the treatment.

After collection, the three isolation techniques will be applied to each sample. The techniques will be compared in terms of purity (absence of contamination) and efficiency (EV concentration) using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blotting.",NO,Extracellular Vesicles,OTHER: Differential ultracentrifugation|OTHER: OptiPrep™ density gradient ultracentrifugation|OTHER: Size-exclusion chromatography|OTHER: Combined techniques,"Purety, Purety of EV isolation, 3 months","Efficiency, Efficiency in terms of number of particles, 3 months|RNA efficiency, Efficiency in terms of RIN scoring, 6 months",,"University Hospital, Ghent",University Ghent,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,4,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,ONZ-2024-0419|G096624N,2025-04,2025-09,2025-12,2025-05-01,,2025-05-01,"Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, 9000, Belgium",

NCT06952712,Aspirin 150 mg vs 100 mg for Prevention of Preeclampsia in High-Risk Obese Pregnant Women,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952712,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), pregnancy-induced hypertension is defined as a new onset of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg after 20 weeks of gestation, with at least 4 hours between two blood pressure measurements, and blood pressure can return to normal after childbirth. Preeclampsia is defined as the presence of proteinuria or multi-organ dysfunction on the basis of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Obese women are a high-risk group for preeclampsia, and the preventive use of low-dose aspirin (LDA) is one of the currently recognized effective interventions. Obesity, as an independent risk factor for preeclampsia, can increase the risk of the disease by 2 to 3 times. With the rising global obesity rate, the prevention and control of preeclampsia in obese pregnant women has become an important challenge in the field of perinatal medicine. The WHO report indicates that the incidence of preeclampsia in obese women is significantly higher, with a 20-30% increase in preeclampsia risk for every 5-unit increase in BMI. The incidence of preeclampsia in obese women can reach 15-25%. At present, the clinical application of oral aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia in China mainly follows authoritative consensuses such as the ""Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy (2020)"", which recommends that high-risk pregnant women (such as those with obesity, chronic hypertension, and a history of preeclampsia in the previous pregnancy) take low-dose aspirin (50-150 mg/d) orally from 12 to 16 weeks of gestation for prevention. However, in actual clinical practice, a dose of 100 mg/d is commonly used, and there is still a lack of clear guidance on whether the dose needs to be adjusted for obese pregnant women. At present, the dose of aspirin mainly used in China is still 100 mg, while foreign studies are more inclined to use 150 mg. Therefore, this study is designed to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of 100 mg and 150 mg aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in obese pregnant women, to optimize the LDA strategy for the prevention of preeclampsia and provide high-quality evidence for clinical practice.",NO,Preeclampsia,DRUG: Aspirin 100mg|DRUG: Aspirin 150mg,"The incidence of preeclampsia, Hypertension and proteinuria or other organ dysfunction occur after 20 weeks of gestation, Within one week of delivery","Incidence of severe preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Severe preeclampsia or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy occur in pregnant women, Within one week of delivery|Outcome of the fetus, The incidence of SGA, premature birth and fetal death in utero, Within one week of delivery|Complications of the mother, The incidence of placental abruption, oligohydramnios, HELLP syndrome, and preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage, Within one week of delivery",,FANG HE,,FEMALE,ADULT,PHASE3,1300,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,[2025] Ethics Review NO.059,2025-05-07,2028-05-06,2028-05-06,2025-05-01,,2025-05-08,"Fang He, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510150, China",

People with NT2 may fall asleep suddenly, have trouble staying awake during the day, or may not be able to sleep well at night. They may have difficulty thinking clearly, paying attention, or remembering things, during the day. These symptoms can make daily activities like driving, working, or caring for their families challenging, impacting their quality of life. Orexin is a chemical made in the brain that helps keep a person awake and alert. TAK-360 acts like orexin. Previous studies have shown that medicines that act like orexin may keep people awake.

The main aim of this study is to learn how safe TAK-360 is and how well adults with NT2 tolerate it. Researchers also want to find out if TAK-360 can help people with NT2 stay awake and determine the right dosage needed to do that.

Participants will be randomly (by chance, like drawing names from a hat) assigned to get either TAK-360 or placebo in the treatment period.

The rationale of this research is to investigate the role of chronic inflammation and vitamin B12 deficiency in the onset and severity of idiopathic CTS.

It reflects the combined effect of neutrophil and monocyte-driven innate immunity versus lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immunity. SIRI has been proposed as a robust marker of inflammation in several chronic diseases.

In the current study, SIRI was evaluated in individuals with and without Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) to investigate its potential as an indicator of inflammatory burden., up to 4 weeks","Comparison of vitamin B12, Comparison of vitamin B12 levels between case and control groups, up to 4 weeks|Evaluation of Electromyography severity, EMG (Electromyography) intensity/amplitude is an important parameter used in the electrical measurement of muscle activity. Electromyography (EMG) severity;

* Mild: Minimal abnormalities with slight spontaneous activity and minor changes in motor unit potentials

* Severe: Extensive spontaneous activity (fibrillations, positive sharp waves), significant reduction or increase in motor unit potentials, and severe recruitment abnormalities, up to 4 weeks|- Comparison of C-Reactive Protein levels (CRP), - Comparison of C-Reactive Protein levels (CRP) levels between case and control groups. CRP is an acute phase protein used as an inflammatory marker. CRP's half-life is approximately 19 hours, making it a responsive marker that can indicate both the onset of inflammation and the response to treatment relatively quickly., up to 4 weeks|Evaluation of Platelet/Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) as an Inflammatory Marker, Platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is another hematological marker that reflects systemic inflammation. During inflammatory responses, platelet counts often increase while lymphocyte counts decrease, resulting in an elevated PLR. Platelets play an active role in inflammation by releasing inflammatory mediators and interacting with leukocytes. PLR, calculated from routine blood tests, has been increasingly used in the assessment of inflammatory conditions.

In this study, PLR values were compared between patients with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) and healthy controls to evaluate its association with inflammation in CTS., up to 4 weeks|Evaluation of Monocyte/Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR) as an Inflammatory Marker, Monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) is a peripheral blood marker used to assess systemic inflammatory status. Monocytes contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling, while lymphocytes are typically reduced in inflammatory states. An increased MLR may reflect an enhanced inflammatory response. Like other ratios, MLR can be easily derived from complete blood count parameters.

In this study, MLR was analyzed in patients with and without Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) to explore its relevance as a potential inflammatory biomarker., up to 4 weeks|Evaluation of Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) as an Inflammatory Marker, In inflammatory diseases, the immune response often leads to an increase in circulating neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes, resulting in an elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This parameter has recently gained attention as a simple, cost-effective, and readily available marker of systemic inflammation. NLR is derived from routine complete blood count tests and reflects the balance between innate (neutrophils) and adaptive (lymphocytes) immune responses.

In the present study, NLR was compared between patients with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) and healthy controls to investigate its potential role as a marker of inflammation in CTS., up to 4 weeks|Evaluation of Systemic Immune-inflammation Index (SII) as an Inflammatory Marker, The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a composite marker calculated using the formula: platelet count × neutrophil count / lymphocyte count. It simultaneously incorporates three types of immune cells and is considered a more comprehensive indicator of the systemic inflammatory status. Elevated SII levels have been associated with various inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions.

NCT06952582,Promoting Safer Sexual Dual Protection Behaviors for Female University Students to Reduce Risks of Both STI/HIV and Unintended Pregnancy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952582,,COMPLETED,"Background: Young women are at the greatest risk for STI/HIV infections and unintended pregnancy resulting from unsafe sexual practices. While there is a growing interest in promoting dual protection as a means of preventing both risks of HIV/STIs and unwanted pregnancy simultaneously, there is limited evidence of effective interventions and strategies for promoting dual protection behaviors in youth based on theoretical models. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model-based safer sexual dual protection (SSDP) intervention to promote safer sexual dual protection behaviors among female university students in Ethiopia.

Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental nonrandomized control group design with a pretest-posttest study to assess changes in the levels of knowledge, motivation, behavioral skills, and practice of safe sexual dual protection behaviors with dual protection use in the intervention group compared to the control group. We recruited 1,020 female university students from two campuses of Mattu University using non-randomized assignment of each campus to either the intervention group or the control group. We collected data from both groups using a self-administered questionnaire at baseline and six months post-intervention. At both times, the collected data were cleaned, edited, and analyzed using SPSS version 23. For the baseline data analysis, we used descriptive statistics to summarize the distribution of participants based on their demographic characteristics and levels of information, motivation, behavioral skills, and behaviors. We also conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS 23 (Teo, 2009; Kline, 2023) to examine correlates and predictors of risky and safer sexual practices and dual protection use and identify important variables to be addressed in targeted intervention for this population. Then, based on the elicitation research findings, we designed IMB-model-based SSDP interventions consisting of 16-hrs sessions to be delivered over a 6 weeks period. To evaluate the intervention effects at posttest, we performed a series of statistical analyses, such as chi-square (χ2) tests of differences between the two groups, along with 95% CI for the differences, and logistic regression analysis of the intervention effects, along with AOR for the effect size measure, after controlling for the effects of other confounding variables.",NO,Sexually Transmitted Infections(STIs)|HIV/AIDS|Unintended Pregnancy,BEHAVIORAL: The IMB model-based safer sexual dual protection educational intervention,"Dual protection use, Percentage (%) of dual protection use among sexually active participants at last sexual intercourse, at 6 months post-intervention","Knowledge of safer sexual dual protection behaviors, Percentage (%) of students who have higher knowledge of safer sexual dual protection behaviors, at 6 months post-intervention|Motivation to practice safer dual protection behaviors, Percentage (%) of students who have a positive attitude toward safer sexual dual protection behaviors, at 6 months post-intervention|Behavioral skills for practicing safer sexual dual protection behaviors, Percentage (%) of students who have higher self-efficacy for safer sexual dual protection behaviors, at 6 months post-intervention",,Jimma University,,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,1020,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,Bonsakoo2003&Ebanufbanti2009,2023-04-01,2023-12-20,2023-12-20,2025-05-01,,2025-05-01,"Metu University, Metu, Oromia, Ethiopia",

NCT06952374,Treating Severe Mitral Valve Annular or Valvular Calcification Using Shockwave Balloon SMARTWAVE,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952374,SMARTMAC,RECRUITING,"Mitral stenosis (MS) is a heavily symptomatic valvular heart disease. Common causes of MS included chronic rheumatic heart disease (CRHD) and mitral annular calcification (MAC). Current guideline recommends percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) being the first line intervention for rheumatic MS with favorable anatomy. However, severely calcified mitral valve (i.e. those with Wilkins scores\>8) makes the mitral valve non-pliable and carries high risk of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (4-19%) with conventional balloon valvuloplasty. MAC is an increasingly recognized disease associated with atherosclerotic risk factors, and a well-recognized valve morphology that responses poorly with PBMV. Besides, conventional open-heart surgery for MAC-associated mitral valve dysfunction carries high mortality. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement with valve-in-MAC has become an alternative in treating these patients. However, valve-in-MAC is not always feasible and still carries operative and 30-day mortality.

Intravascular lithotripsy is an approved adjunct interventional therapy in treating calcified lesions to facilitate stenotic lesion opening in peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease. The off-label use of current peripheral lithotripsy balloon in mitral valve as a compassionate treatment or as an adjunct treatment before mitral balloon valvuloplasty and transcatheter mitral valve replacement has been reported with success . A possible mechanism is that lithotripsy preferentially impacts hard tissue, disrupts calcium, and leaves soft tissue undisturbed, improving valve pliability, preventing leaflet damage, and making subsequent valvuloplasty safer. However, the off-label use of multiple peripheral lithotripsy balloons in mitral valve is technically complicated.

NCT06952335,The Impact Of Respiratory Neuromuscular Stimulation On Patients With Invasive Mechanical Ventilation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952335,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Mechanical ventilation (MV) is an important treatment measure for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). MV is widely used in the treatment of respiratory failure and is also one of the important means of life support for critically ill patients after surgery. Although the use of MV has significantly reduced the mortality rate of critically ill patients, MV is also a double-edged sword. A large amount of evidence shows that it can lead to complications such as ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD) . In a retrospective study, it was first found and proposed that long-term MV can lead to diaphragmatic atrophy. Later, a prospective clinical study conducted by Le Bourdelles et al. provided direct evidence to support this conjecture. Continuous use of mechanical ventilation for 48 hours can cause diaphragmatic atrophy and contractile dysfunction. Therefore, effectively preventing diaphragmatic atrophy is of great significance for the outcome of patients with mechanical ventilation.

Respiratory NMES has been used in clinical practice for decades. Previous studies have shown that electrical stimulation of a certain intensity applied to the respiratory neuromuscular can increase the excitability of the phrenic nerve, enhance diaphragmatic contraction, increase the range of diaphragmatic movement, and improve lung ventilation. In addition to the diaphragm, the abdominal muscles are also an important part of the respiratory muscles and an important supplement to the inspiratory muscles. Studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the abdominal muscles can retrain the expiratory muscles, increase muscle strength, induce expiratory muscle contraction through repeated afferent stimulation of the abdominal muscles, increase intra-abdominal pressure, facilitate the upward movement of the diaphragm, reduce thoracic pressure and lung volume, and thus improve the ability of expiration and expectoration. Electrical stimulation of the abdominal muscles has received increasing attention as a supplement to inspiratory muscle training, and many foreign literatures have reported on the improvement of respiratory function by abdominal muscle stimulation. At present, some domestic scholars have also reported that simultaneous stimulation of the phrenic nerve and abdominal muscles can improve the quality of life and prognosis of patients. However, there are few studies on how simultaneous stimulation of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles can improve the physiological effect indicators of the respiratory system, especially the impact on respiratory drive and inspiratory effort. Animal model studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve in rabbits can significantly reduce the central drive of the diaphragm and the conduction function of the phrenic nerve after diaphragmatic fatigue, and the reduction of central drive may be a self-protective mechanism of the body. An observational study abroad suggested that percutaneous diaphragmatic electrical stimulation can control WOB within four-fifths of the normal range 96.8% of the time.

This hemophilic arthropathy (HA) is characterized by chronic pain, periarticular atrophy and a limited range of motion. HA affects the perceived quality of life in the PwH. This painful situation can lead to catastrophizing thoughts that movement and physical activity will result in further pain and injury, when that painful situation is perceived as threatening. One component of this fear-model includes fear of movement, or kinesiophobia (KP). KP is defined as an irrational and disadvantaging fear of physical movement and activity resulting from feeling vulnerable to painful injury or reinjury. Patients with KP develop the belief that movements will lead to re-injury and pain. Over time, this leads to decreased physical activity, avoidance of daily tasks, functional decline, reluctance to use extremities, and in advanced stages, may result in depression and reduced quality of life. Although factors associated with KP have been examined in various diseases groups such as chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, migraine, coronary artery disease and rheumatoid arthritis, there is limited research on KP and its predictors in PwH.

NCT06952257,Relationship Between Anesthetic Regimen and Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome (BCIS),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06952257,BCIS,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"The annual incidence of geriatric hip fractures in the United States is 325,000 and is projected to rise given the aging population.1 The mainstay of treatment is cemented hip hemiarthroplasty. Bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) is a serious perioperative complication unique to cemented arthroplasty characterized by hypoxia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and in severe cases, cardiac arrest. BCIS is associated with significantly higher rates of unplanned intubation, vasopressor use, prolonged hospitalization, and 30-day mortality.

Given the rising incidence of hip fractures, the identification of readily modifiable risk factors for BCIS such as anesthetic regimen is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, a prospective study comparing the rate of BCIS development between general and neuraxial anesthesia is currently lacking. Additionally, no studies have examined how the anesthetic regimen affects histamine and complement levels. Therefore, this pilot study aims to investigate the effect of anesthetic regimen on BCIS development as well as on histamine and complement levels in patients undergoing cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture. The investigators hypothesize that neuraxial anesthesia will be associated with lower rates of BCIS as well as lower histamine and complement levels compared to general anesthesia.

The primary objective of this pilot study is to compare the effect of general and neuraxial anesthesia on the incidence and severity of BCIS in patients undergoing cemented hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture.

Secondary objectives include examining postoperative outcomes associated with BCIS, such as cardiac arrhythmias, unplanned intubation, hypoxia necessitating supplemental oxygen, altered mental status, and in-hospital mortality.

Additional objectives include comparing histamine and complement levels between anesthetic regimens as well as between patients with and without BCIS",NO,Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome,PROCEDURE: Administration of general anaesthesia|PROCEDURE: Neuraxial Analgesia,"Number of Participants with Hypoxia, Grade 1 BCIS, defined as moderate intraoperative hypoxia (\<94%) or drop in systolic blood pressure of \>20%) intraoperatively.

Existing tools such as SCORE2 and the CUORE project provide important insights into cardiovascular risk but are limited in their ability to account for the interplay of multiple coexisting conditions.

Objective: The primary aim of this prospective cohort study is to develop and validate a novel cardiovascular risk prediction model specifically tailored for patients with at least two concomitant chronic diseases. Secondary objectives include comparing the predictive performance of the new model with that of SCORE2 and the CUORE project, and quantifying the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding, and overall mortality in this high-risk population.

Methods: This is a prospective, monocentric, observational cohort study with an expected duration of 144 months. Patients ≥18 years with at least two of a predefined list of chronic conditions will be recruited at the Thrombosis Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS.
